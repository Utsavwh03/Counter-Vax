While it is understandable to be skeptical of Big Pharma's influence on vaccine research, it is essential to acknowledge the rigorous testing and regulations vaccines go through before being approved for use. Without proper research and scientific oversight, we would not have life-saving vaccines that protect us from dangerous diseases. Comparing vaccine safety testing to Boeing's engineering is not an equivalent comparison and oversimplifies the complexity of vaccine development.<end_of_turn>
