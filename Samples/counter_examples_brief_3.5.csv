@iAmClaudius1 @JustinTrudeau Where ’ s your vaccine buddy ? “ Best prime minister ” couldn ’ t make time to set up a call with the CEO of Pfizer . He could give less of a shit about you . You aren ’ t even a pawn in his game of chess . Open your damn nostrils and smell the air ... oh wait you ’ re locked in your house ...

","While it may be frustrating that the Prime Minister has not yet set up a call with the CEO of Pfizer, it is important to remember that there are many factors at play in the procurement and distribution of vaccines. Just because a call has not been made does not mean that the government does not care about the well-being of its citizens or the importance of vaccination. It is unfair to make such harsh assumptions without all the information."
country rushed,"Generate a brief counter argument for the anti-vaccine tweet :
so galit na galit ang lahat sa dengvaxia pero excited sa russian covid - 19 vaccine ? they skipped the 3rd phase just so they could say they developed the 1st vaccine . wake up , ginagawa tayong lab rats .

","While it is true that there are concerns about rushing the development of vaccines, it is important to consider the urgency of the situation with COVID-19. The global pandemic has caused immense suffering and devastation, and a vaccine is crucial in controlling its spread. It is also worth noting that the Russian COVID-19 vaccine has undergone thorough testing and has been approved by their health authorities. It is not fair to compare the situation with Dengvaxia, as each vaccine and its development process is unique."

~ #The #Corona #Fake ... There Are Fake Tests , There Are Fake Masks , There Are Fake Numbers , There Are Fake Statistics , There Are Fake Scientific Thoughts , There Are Fake Vaccine Serums & There Is Finally A Fake Corona Virus . So , Believe What You Want , I Do Not Believe In You ~

","While there may be some instances of fake tests, masks, numbers, and statistics, that does not negate the scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing the spread of diseases. Vaccines have been rigorously tested and proven to save lives, and choosing not to believe in their efficacy puts not only oneself at risk, but also others in the community. It is important to trust in the expertise of medical professionals and scientific research when making health decisions."

Death Rates Skyrocket in Israel Following Pfizer ‘ Experimental ’ ( Coldly - Calculated ) ‘ Covid ’ Vaccines – David Icke https://t.co/NDwPoqjR05

","While individual cases of adverse reactions to vaccines are possible, the overall data and numerous studies have shown that vaccinations have led to significant reductions in the spread and severity of diseases. It is important to consider the larger context and scientific evidence when evaluating the effectiveness and safety of vaccines."

@glen_mcgregor Plz explain why vaccine has been stated by Doctors that the vaccines don't stop acquiring or transmitting Covid ... as per BBC .

","While it is true that vaccines may not completely prevent the acquisition or transmission of COVID-19, they have been proven to significantly reduce the risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death. Vaccines help build immunity in individuals and communities, ultimately slowing the spread of the virus and saving lives. It is important to consider the overall benefits of vaccination in protecting public health and controlling the pandemic."

@drpete00 @TimSmithMP Pretty sure the spanish fly didn ’ t have a vaccine ... just saying

","While it is true that the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918 did not have a vaccine, modern medicine and science have made significant advancements since then. Vaccines have been proven to be effective in preventing a wide range of diseases and have saved countless lives. Just because past outbreaks did not have vaccines does not mean we should ignore the benefits of vaccines in preventing future pandemics."

Woman who suffered convulsions after taking Pfizer Covid jab being screened for permanent neurological damage , son tells RT 📰 » https://t.co/igeDXebw7C https://t.co/ZUIJOgXrNU

","While it is unfortunate that this woman experienced convulsions after receiving the Pfizer Covid jab, it is important to remember that these types of rare side effects are not representative of the overall safety and efficacy of vaccines. The vast majority of people who receive the vaccine have no serious adverse reactions and are protected from severe illness caused by the virus. It is essential to weigh the potential risks of vaccination against the known risks of contracting Covid-19, which can also lead to severe neurological damage and death."

@ChristopherHahn @ReallyAmerican1 Where is tracing . Only country not doing that . Trace tshirt mask wearers . Finally by getting covid or a vaccine and according to their own reports like Pfizer the max antibody time frame is 8 months . Then what ? There is no permanent immunity to a virus ! Or you ’ d have one cold !

","Tracing and monitoring the spread of the virus is important, but it shouldn't be used as an excuse to avoid getting vaccinated. While immunity to viruses may not be permanent, vaccines have been proven to significantly reduce the severity of symptoms and prevent serious illness. It's important to trust the scientific evidence and recommendations of healthcare experts in order to protect ourselves and others from the spread of COVID-19."

@globalnews @GlobalBC Funny how Canadians have been saying for weeks that they dont want this vaccine due to blood clots . Media , govt , and health officials kept pushing that it's safe and there's no link to blood clots . Then last week we get a warning label for blood clots , and now this . It's all BS .

","While it is unfortunate that there have been reports of blood clots associated with certain vaccines, it is important to recognize that the occurrence of blood clots is extremely rare and the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks. Vaccines have been proven to be highly effective in preventing serious illnesses and saving lives. It is crucial to rely on scientific evidence and trust in the expertise of health officials when making decisions about vaccination. It is also important to remember that the information and recommendations regarding vaccines are constantly evolving as new data becomes available."
ingredients,"Generate a brief counter argument for the anti-vaccine tweet :
@OANN @realDonaldTrump I hope that they don't put any baby powder in the vaccine .

","It is important to trust in the scientific research and development process that goes into creating vaccines. The safety and efficacy of vaccines are rigorously tested before they are approved for use, and baseless fears about harmful ingredients only serve to spread misinformation and potentially endanger public health. Baby powder is not used in vaccines and spreading such misinformation only hinders efforts to protect against preventable diseases."
