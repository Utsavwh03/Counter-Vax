@CNN Nobody is going to take the stupid vaccine ! No health worker will be force to take it either . The biggest Eruption of the health industry is forcing workers to take Bad unproven vaccine that could Fu * k up many lives forever . I would rather have covid again , than to take a vaccine

","While it’s understandable to have concerns about vaccines, it’s important to recognize that extensive research and rigorous testing have demonstrated their safety and efficacy. Vaccines undergo comprehensive evaluations by regulatory agencies before approval, and they have been crucial in preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19. Health care workers, who are on the front lines, are often encouraged to get vaccinated not just for their own protection, but to safeguard their patients and the community. The benefits of vaccination in controlling the pandemic and returning to a sense of normalcy outweigh the risks of potential side effects, which are generally mild and temporary. Choosing to get vaccinated is a step toward collective safety and health."

@JaroGiesbrecht @charlesadler @kinsellawarren The are also going to approve the AstraZeneca vaccine even though it's still being tested for efficacy . Thanks I'll wait even though I'm in my 80 ' s and immune compromised . I want to know whatever I'm taking is safe and effective

","While it's understandable to prioritize safety and efficacy, it's important to consider that extensive clinical trials and ongoing monitoring help ensure vaccines like AstraZeneca are safe for public use. Regulatory agencies have evaluated the data and approved the vaccine based on rigorous standards. Waiting indefinitely can expose you to higher risks from preventable diseases, especially given your age and health status. Vaccines not only protect individuals but also contribute to community immunity, helping to safeguard those who are more vulnerable."

@MattHancock @MHRAgovuk @pfizer @BioNTech_Group Why has it been granted that they are exempt from any issues arising from taking the vaccine ? If it is 100 % safe and has been properly tested then surely this isn't necessary

","While it’s understandable to be concerned about liability and safety, it's important to recognize that vaccine manufacturers are subject to rigorous testing and regulatory oversight before vaccines are authorized for use. The liability exemptions for vaccine makers are designed to ensure that they can respond quickly to public health emergencies without the fear of overwhelming legal challenges, which could hinder innovation and access. Furthermore, the benefits of widespread vaccination—reducing disease transmission, preventing severe illness, and protecting vulnerable populations—far outweigh the risks associated with any potential side effects. Vaccines have undergone extensive clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, and ongoing monitoring continues to ensure their safety in the general population."

“ They ’ re gonna come up w / a vaccine & in that vaccine , everybody is gonna have to take it … & inside of that vaccine there ’ s going to be some type of electronic computer device that ’ s gonna put some type of chip in you & maybe even have some mood , mind - altering circumstances , ”

","The claim that vaccines contain microchips or mind-altering devices is unfounded and rooted in misinformation. Vaccines are rigorously tested for safety and efficacy by scientific and regulatory bodies worldwide. The primary purpose of vaccines is to prevent disease and protect public health, not to control or alter individuals. The idea of microchipping through vaccines lacks any scientific basis and overlooks the comprehensive research and transparency in the vaccine development process. Spreading fear through such claims undermines the importance of vaccination in preventing severe illnesses and saving lives."

@BallouxFrancois Without Phase 3 safety and efficacy data the Russian vaccine is a none starter outside Russia . That ’ s how the system works

","While it's essential to prioritize safety and efficacy in vaccine development, it’s worth noting that not all vaccines undergo the same rigorous processes in every country. Some nations might prioritize rapid responses due to urgent public health needs, particularly in crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, existing data from prior studies, real-world use, and ongoing monitoring can provide valuable insights into a vaccine's safety and effectiveness, even without formal Phase 3 completion. Dismissing a vaccine outright may hinder potential access to lifesaving interventions, especially in regions with limited resources."

@allancarr3192 @jennyfaebelfast @Pfizer_UK In Argentina for a couple of years there is no passport , driving license , education or health care without vaccination . This has all been planned for a long time . Evil .

","While concerns about personal freedom and individual choice are valid, the measures in Argentina regarding vaccination passports are primarily aimed at protecting public health, especially during a pandemic. Vaccinations help prevent the spread of infectious diseases, reduce hospitalizations, and ultimately save lives. Such policies are not about control but rather about ensuring community safety and encouraging higher vaccination rates for herd immunity. Historical data consistently shows that vaccines are one of the most effective public health interventions, and the focus should be on protecting vulnerable populations rather than viewing these measures as nefarious."

@edstetzer Ed , to be fair , we all know it's only the Russian vaccine that ends up tattooing 666 on one's forehead . You know , Gog and Magog and all that , which , in translation is ( I'm told ) , "" Gates and Putin for the Win ! ""

","While the tweet raises a humorous point about conspiracy theories surrounding vaccines, it's important to ground our discussions in facts. Vaccines, including those developed in Russia, have undergone rigorous testing for safety and efficacy by multiple health organizations worldwide. The idea of a vaccine tattooing a mark or symbol is a fringe conspiracy theory lacking any scientific evidence. Misinformation can lead to vaccine hesitancy, which ultimately jeopardizes public health, especially in the face of preventable diseases. Engaging in unfounded claims can distract us from the real benefits of vaccination and the importance of protecting our communities through science and medicine."

@realDonaldTrump ... His role in Moderna is where he made his fortune and established his connections . Let that sink in . Wake up people ! You are being conditioned and controlled . Please copy and paste this , I did !

","While it's important to scrutinize the financial and political connections of any public figure, attributing vaccine hesitancy solely to personal financial gain overlooks the extensive scientific research and rigorous regulatory processes that vaccines undergo. Vaccines, including those developed by Moderna, have been shown through clinical trials to be safe and effective in preventing severe illness from COVID-19. Public health decisions should be based on evidence from experts in the field rather than conspiracy theories. Encouraging open dialogue grounded in scientific understanding can foster a more informed public rather than perpetuating unfounded fears."

Do you honestly believe that people accept what you are doing and saying with your killer vaccine and your Nazi Style vaccine passport , do everyone a favour and quit . Winston Churchill will be turning in his grave . @BorisJohnson TIME TO END THIS HOAX #fakepandemic

","While concerns about vaccine mandates and personal freedoms are valid topics for discussion, it's important to recognize the overwhelming scientific consensus on the safety and efficacy of vaccines in preventing serious illness and death from COVID-19. Comparing vaccine efforts to Nazi policies undermines the gravity of historical atrocities and diverts attention from the public health benefits of vaccination. Vaccines are a crucial tool in combating the pandemic, protecting not just individuals but also vulnerable populations and helping to restore normalcy to society. Dismissing them as part of a ""hoax"" ignores the realities faced by healthcare workers and the millions who have suffered due to the virus. Engaging in constructive dialogue based on facts is far more beneficial than spreading misinformation."

Fall 2021 : Somehow , the latest COVID vaccine has caused the zombie apocalypse . Terror reigns in the streets ! Cancers : https://t.co/z9n9B2KuJ9

","The claim suggesting that the COVID vaccine has caused a ""zombie apocalypse"" is not only hyperbolic but also scientifically unfounded. Vaccines undergo rigorous testing and monitoring to ensure their safety and efficacy. The CDC and WHO have consistently reported that vaccines significantly reduce the risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19. Instead of spreading fear and misinformation, we should promote reliable scientific evidence that supports vaccination as a crucial tool in controlling the pandemic and protecting public health. Spreading false narratives undermines the critical public health efforts needed to combat both COVID-19 and misinformation."

@ElContador2000 @DebraClaridge Foetal material , mercury , an isolated strand of RNA to produce covid spike protein , quantum dot any or all of these . We don't need a vaccine cultured antibody cells worked .

","While I understand concerns regarding vaccine ingredients and methods, it's important to emphasize that vaccines undergo rigorous testing and monitoring to ensure their safety and efficacy. The use of mRNA in COVID-19 vaccines does not contain live virus or significant amounts of any harmful substances, like thimerosal (mercury). Furthermore, vaccines have been shown to provide broad immunity and protection against severe disease, which is critical for public health. Relying solely on antibodies from previous infections may not guarantee the same level of protection, especially as variants emerge. Vaccination is a scientifically validated method that helps not only individuals but also protects the entire community by promoting herd immunity."

","While it's important to scrutinize the practices of pharmaceutical companies, focusing solely on Pfizer's past does not negate the overwhelming evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of their COVID-19 vaccine. Regulatory bodies, including the FDA and WHO, have conducted rigorous evaluations to ensure that vaccines meet high safety standards. The benefits of widespread vaccination in reducing COVID-19 transmission and severity significantly outweigh concerns about the company’s history. Trusting science involves recognizing the collective expertise and research from the global scientific community that supports vaccination as a critical tool in controlling the pandemic."

Halt ! ! Volunteer in the U . K . trial got transverse myelitis inflammatory syndrome affects spinal cord sparked by viral infections AstraZeneca ’ s vaccine relies on a chimpanzee adenovirus modified to carry coronavirus genes and deliver them into human cells . https://t.co/3qrtra9uxd

","While the case of transverse myelitis in the trial participant is concerning, it is important to recognize that adverse events can occur with any medical intervention, including vaccines. The occurrence of such events is typically rigorously investigated to determine causality. In the case of the AstraZeneca vaccine, large-scale clinical trials and ongoing monitoring have shown that the benefits of vaccination—such as reducing severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19—far outweigh the risks of rare side effects. Regulatory agencies continuously assess data to ensure vaccine safety, and these evaluations have consistently supported the vaccine's overall safety and efficacy. It's crucial to rely on comprehensive evidence rather than isolated incidents to inform public health decisions."

I will take the vaccine if it ever gets down to nobodies like me , but only if it's Pfizer or Moderna , not Astrazeneca . They are not made the same , and I think Astrazeneca is inferior in safety and efficacy .

","While it's important to have preferences based on personal research, it's crucial to recognize that AstraZeneca's vaccine has undergone rigorous testing and has been authorized by multiple health agencies worldwide, including the WHO and EMA. Studies have demonstrated its efficacy in preventing severe disease and hospitalization. Focusing solely on brand may overlook the broader benefits of vaccination overall, as all authorized vaccines significantly contribute to public health by reducing transmission and community spread of COVID-19. Ultimately, the best choice is to get vaccinated with any available option to protect both individual health and the community at large."

@oldivory I was wondering about that , too ! My mom died of a bad reaction to the regular flu shot , so I'm a little reluctant to take a chance . Also , Pfizer is a major donor to Republicans , so not exactly a vote in their favor .

","While it's understandable to have concerns stemming from personal experiences, it's important to consider that severe reactions to vaccines are extremely rare. The benefits of vaccination, such as protection against serious illness and the spread of infectious diseases, generally far outweigh the risks. Additionally, vaccine development and approval processes involve rigorous safety evaluations by health authorities, independent of political affiliations. Making informed decisions based on scientific evidence, rather than anecdotal experiences or political ties, is crucial for personal and public health."
