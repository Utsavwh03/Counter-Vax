1376129799350018053t,"“ Another Covid 19 vaccine casualty Illaria Pappa 31 school teacher from #Italy died from thromboembolism 10 days after receiving #AstraZeneca #vaccine "" https://t.co/6QQzoODaoD",side-effect,"While tragic, the case of Illaria Pappa's death should be viewed in the broader context of vaccine safety. Thromboembolism can occur for various reasons, and rare adverse events must be weighed against the benefits of vaccination in preventing severe COVID-19. Regulatory agencies continuously monitor vaccine safety and have found that the overall risk of such events remains very low compared to the risks associated with COVID-19 itself, which can lead to serious complications and death in far greater numbers. It's crucial to avoid drawing conclusions from isolated incidents without considering the larger data and evidence on vaccine efficacy and safety."
1328486731033800705t,"@realDonaldTrump ( 11 / 16/2020 ) It ’ s simply a matter of demonic control to take your STUFF through #SocialCreditScores #MandatoryVaccines #Eugenics #VotedForBiden ? Then YOU failed the #IQTest . Minions were asleep during #NineEleven , #Spygate , #GainOfFunction . But we give them #ElectionFraud ? ! #WOW",mandatory political religious,"While it’s easy to attribute complex societal issues to “demonic control” and label dissenters as “minions,” this oversimplifies the nuanced discussions surrounding topics like social credit scores, public health measures, and electoral integrity. Many people have legitimate concerns and differing opinions based on personal experiences and values, rather than a failure of intelligence or awareness. Framing these issues in divisive terms only serves to deepen polarizations instead of fostering constructive dialogue."
1392287948729724931t,"Reported vaccine injuries continue to climb , Pfizer seeks full approval for COVID vaccine | News | LifeSite https://t.co/B38NMx5kM3",side-effect,"While it's important to monitor and report vaccine injuries, the data must be contextualized. The vast majority of COVID-19 vaccine recipients experience no serious side effects, and the benefits of vaccination in preventing COVID-19 complications, hospitalizations, and deaths far outweigh the risks of rare adverse events. Vaccine approval processes are rigorous and based on extensive clinical trials that demonstrate safety and efficacy. It's crucial to rely on comprehensive scientific evidence rather than selective reporting to guide public health decisions."
1289300993612681217t,"@BorisJohnson No matter what you do , @BorisJohnson will frig the stats so we have another lockdown and then force Bill Gates ' vaccine on you . All part of ID2020 & 1 world government . This bozo can't even stop migrants being ferried from France . What makes you think he wants to protect the UK ?",conspiracy mandatory,"While concerns about government transparency and vaccine safety are valid, it’s important to recognize that public health measures are often guided by expert advice and data. Lockdowns and vaccinations have been shown to save lives during pandemics. Blaming one individual for complex issues like migration or pandemic response oversimplifies the challenges faced by governments. Constructive criticism and engagement are more effective than spreading conspiracy theories."
1355960886507286536t,"@Jasmineinda619 I agree with you . Wholeheartedly . My dad asked me about getting a vaccine with him when he gets one in a few weeks through his government job . Told him no way , I don't trust the shots with a 10 foot pole . He was miffed , and tried to be like "" Oh you got shots as a kid .. """,none,"While it's understandable to have concerns about vaccines, it's important to recognize that vaccines undergo rigorous testing and monitoring for safety and efficacy. The vaccines developed for COVID-19 have been evaluated by independent experts and have been shown to significantly reduce the risk of severe illness and hospitalization. Trusting the science and expert recommendations can help protect not just ourselves, but also our loved ones and the community at large."
1347872014032384002t,"REASONS TO INJECT COVID - 19 VACCINE 5 . EXPERIMENTAL RNA The Moderna vaccine , pushed by Dr . Anthony Fauci , and financed by Bill Gates , used an experimental mRNA technology that claimed to allow rapid deployment without the usual pre - clinical and animal studies . #vaccine #COVID19",rushed,"While it’s true that the Moderna vaccine utilizes mRNA technology, it's important to note that this approach is not as experimental as it may seem. mRNA technology has been in development for decades, and the scientific community has conducted extensive research on its safety and efficacy prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the accelerated timeline for vaccine deployment was made possible by unprecedented global collaboration and funding, which allowed for the simultaneous conduct of phases of clinical trials. The rigorous testing processes—including multiple phases of human trials—ensured that the vaccines meet safety standards before being made available to the public."
1169637442191687680t,"@sacbee_news @GavinNewsom 1 prescription drug which is taken orally has about 100 side effects and affects people of different types differently . For ex , a drug with sulphur might affect you but not someone else . How do you expect an injected vaccine , to not effect each child differently ?",side-effect,"While it's true that different individuals can react differently to both medications and vaccines, vaccines undergo extensive testing to ensure their safety and efficacy across diverse populations before approval. The side effects of vaccines are typically mild and temporary, while the risks associated with the diseases they prevent can be severe and long-lasting. The benefits of vaccines in protecting public health far outweigh the potential risks. Additionally, the monitoring systems in place track any adverse reactions, allowing for ongoing safety assessments."
1260258769524662276t,the lady who gives the animals vaccines didn ’ t even know that Aluminum AND Formaldehyde which are HARMFUL ingredients are in all vaccines kinda sounded confused .. exactly they don ’ t teach facts about vaccines in school they ’ re poison and can cause illnesses ! #vaccinesArePoison,ingredients side-effect,"While it’s understandable to have concerns about vaccine ingredients, it's essential to clarify that both aluminum and formaldehyde are used in vaccines in very small, safe amounts. Public health organizations like the CDC and WHO confirm that these ingredients have been extensively studied and are present at levels far below those that would cause harm. Vaccines are rigorously tested for safety and efficacy, and the benefits of vaccination in preventing serious diseases far outweigh any potential risks. Misinformation can create unnecessary fear, which can ultimately harm public health efforts."
1298846810929324032t,I wouldn ’ t take a vaccine this admin made available for a gazillion million dollars . I ’ d get covid again . These clowns can ’ t be trusted with that kind of science . This only makes me more terrified they will rush a vaccine to make their own miracle ...,pharma rushed,"It's important to remember that vaccines undergo rigorous testing and regulatory scrutiny before they're approved, regardless of the administration in power. Many scientists and healthcare experts, independent of political influence, work tirelessly to ensure safety and efficacy. Trusting in established medical protocols and evidence-based science is crucial, especially when vaccines have been proven to save lives and significantly reduce the severity of illness. Choosing to avoid vaccination could lead to severe health consequences, not just for individuals but for the broader community as well."
1377864398027419650t,"Blood clots after receiving AstraZeneca vaccine "" Central venous sinus thrombosis is a very rare disorder that is previously not been known to be associated with vaccination , however it has been noted as a complication of people who have contracted COVID - 19 "" https://t.co/G0DUkfSu97",side-effect,"While it's true that central venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is rare, attributing its occurrence exclusively to COVID-19 overlooks important evidence. Studies have shown a higher incidence of thrombosis in vaccinated individuals compared to those who have not been vaccinated and who contract COVID-19. It's crucial to consider the broader context of these events and the monitoring of vaccine safety, rather than downplaying potential risks associated with vaccination."
