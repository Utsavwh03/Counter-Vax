 @RT_com Injecting a Russian vaccine is like depending on a Lada as your daily driver",Perhaps the vaccine might just save your life though??,"I would have to argue with both of these here. It may not be 'fancy' and 'well-known' as other cars, but there are no safety issues with it. Could say the same thing about the vaccine. Not everything that comes from Russia needs to be terrible, only the Putin.","While the comparison of a vaccine to a car may seem humorous, it's important to remember that vaccines, including those developed in Russia, undergo rigorous testing and scrutiny to ensure their safety and efficacy. The focus should be on the scientific data and peer-reviewed research supporting any vaccine, rather than dismissing it based on nationality or brand. Just as the reliability of a vehicle can vary widely regardless of its origin, so too can the quality of vaccines. Making informed health decisions requires evaluating the evidence, not resorting to stereotypes.","While it may seem unusual to consider injecting a foreign vaccine, vaccines have been proven time and again in numerous successful trials. Just because something might be unfamiliar or different does not mean it cannot provide protection against harmful diseases. It's important to trust scientific research and evidence-based practices when deciding what vaccinations are safe and effective. #TrustScience #VaccineSafetyMatters","Just because something may not be considered top-of-the-line or well known, doesn't mean it can never work. The quality of any product should ultimately determine its effectiveness and reliability in meeting expectations. It would still serve to protect against COVID -19 regardless if produced by Russia instead of another country with more established pharmaceutical reputation. Rushing judgement without considering all aspects could lead one astray from potentially beneficial options available within their reach at","Injecting a vaccine with proven safety and efficacy is crucial in preventing the spread of deadly diseases, including COVID-19. The decision to rely solely on a vaccine from Russia may be a short term solution to a global pandemic but ultimately it could lead to more long-term harm if not followed by adequate testing and monitoring procedures. It's important to consider all factors before making decisions regarding vaccination. #WorldVision"

 More than a coincidence then that the 3 billionaires funding the Pfizer vaccine have all stated that in their opinion the biggest problem we have is overpopulation.",Perhaps the 3 billionaires could share some of their wealth with the population then,"It is, have you been on public transport lately? I would believe it when I see death rates from the vaccines. So far, there are so many more deaths from COVID, do you think it was those 3 billionaires who sponsored it too?","The claim that billionaires funding the Pfizer vaccine have a hidden agenda related to overpopulation lacks substantive evidence. Vaccine development is a complex process supported by extensive scientific research and public health considerations. The primary aim of vaccines is to prevent illness and protect communities from outbreaks, ultimately saving lives. Additionally, attributing health initiatives to a conspiracy disregards the overwhelming consensus among medical professionals that vaccines are crucial for global health. Instead of speculating on motives, we should focus on the data-driven benefits of vaccination in controlling diseases and improving public wellbeing.","Actually, it's more logical to assume that they are not coincidentally supporting population control measures when promoting vaccines as part of addressing global health issues related to population growth and density. The focus on vaccination should be based on scientific evidence rather than personal opinions or biases towards controlling populations. It's important to prioritize public health initiatives without resorting to conspiracy theories about population management. Additionally, the emphasis on vaccinations can help prevent potential future crises due to uncontrolled population growth. There could be valid reasons behind these statements","While it may be interesting to consider if there could potentially be any connection between these wealthy individuals' beliefs on population growth and their support of certain health initiatives, attributing causality based solely on this correlation would not provide sufficient evidence or reasoning behind such claims without further investigation into each individual case separately. It also ignores other possible motivations they might hold beyond simply addressing concerns about public health issues like COVID-19 through supporting research efforts towards developing effective solutions via financial contributions","While it may be true that many wealthy individuals are donating funds towards developing a vaccine against COVID-19, it does not necessarily mean they believe in the importance of population control or any other global issue. The focus should be on finding a solution to the pandemic rather than simply supporting specific initiatives. Ultimately, promoting health and wellness through vaccination efforts is crucial to save lives during a crisis. #VaccinesSaveLives. �"

 If the whole Covid schema is a SCAM (as the producer of tests R. Hodkinson said) how can you possibly do a ""classical vaccine"" as previous? ⚡️💉 YOU CAN'T 💉⚡️ Hence is all synthetic and pure gene-therapy! GMO-humans. https://t.co/8KNjFbhVCD",Do you know anything about vaccines at all?? some are live vaccines whilst others are synthetically produced,"I have a strong view of people claiming something GMO is automatically negative. there really is NO proof that is the case. I do not know enough about the structure of vaccines to argue here, but even if they are classed as GMO, what exactly is wrong with that?","While it’s important to critically evaluate our sources, the statement that Covid vaccines are simply a form of ""gene therapy"" oversimplifies the science involved. Vaccines, including mRNA vaccines, are designed to teach our immune systems to recognize and fight pathogens without altering our DNA. The claim that the entire Covid schema is a scam ignores the extensive research, trials, and regulations that underpin vaccine development, as well as the overwhelming scientific consensus on their safety and efficacy. Vaccines have played a critical role in reducing illness and mortality, and misinformation can hinder public health efforts.","While it's true that some critics may question the COVID-19 pandemic, dismissing vaccines entirely based on misinformation could have serious consequences for public health. Vaccines go through rigorous testing and regulatory processes to ensure their safety and efficacy before being approved by authorities. Additionally, while genetic engineering might be used in certain medical applications, it does not automatically mean that humans are inherently genetically modified or unhealthy. It is important to rely on scientific evidence and expert opinions when discussing these complex topics. #COVID19 #vacc","While it may be true that there are different approaches to creating COVID treatments, dismissing them outright without evidence or understanding their potential benefits could hinder progress in finding effective solutions against this virus. It’s important to consider multiple perspectives before making conclusions about complex scientific issues like these ones related to healthcare advancements such biotechnology methods have been instrumental during pandemics throughout history by helping save lives faster than traditional means would allow us. Therefore we should remain","While it may seem like an unusual claim, there are many scientific studies that support the idea that synthetic genes can be inserted into human cells without harming or affecting the body's ability to fight off diseases. Additionally, developing a traditional vaccine requires years of research and testing before being approved by regulatory agencies. The use of genetic modification in new products such as COVID-19 treatments could potentially save lives and prevent further spread of the virus. It"

 @inquirerdotnet Duturte is either working with Trump to bring down the deep state or he's really not to bright. If he is really pushing a vaccine that means he's siding with China. He'll be in huge trouble once the Truth about this covid hoax comes out.",How is pushing a vaccine siding with China?? it's about protecting world health!!,"The vaccines have been extremely beneficial and reduced levels of COVID across the world. How is supporting something that has proven effective ""siding"" with someone? Worldwide collaboration is what we need to fight the pandemic.","While it's essential to question political motives, dismissing vaccines as a ""hoax"" undermines the extensive scientific research supporting their safety and efficacy. Vaccines have played a crucial role in controlling infectious diseases and saving lives globally. Associating vaccine promotion with political agendas distracts from the genuine public health benefits they provide. It's vital to rely on credible science rather than conspiracy theories when it comes to health decisions.","It is important to fact-check and verify information before making such baseless accusations. Without concrete evidence, it is premature to jump to conclusions based on political affiliations alone. It would also be irresponsible to spread misinformation without any credible sources backing up your claims. Trusting in facts and scientific research will help us make informed decisions moving forward. Let’s focus on getting vaccines approved by regulatory bodies rather than spreading unfounded conspiracy theories. #trustInScience #PandemicVaccine #COVID19 #Trust","It would also show his willingness and dedication towards protecting public health, regardless of political affiliations. Blaming him solely on personal motives without evidence could lead us astray from addressing important issues at hand like finding effective solutions during times when unity should take precedence over partisanship. Let’s focus more socio-economic factors instead - such as accessibility/distributional equity related concerns regarding COVID19 measures rather than accusing individuals based purely","While it may seem like a strange choice of words, there are legitimate concerns surrounding the efficacy and safety of any COVID-19 vaccine. It is important to trust experts and data rather than spreading misinformation. The priority should be on finding a solution to the global pandemic instead of making baseless accusations. Blaming someone based on their political beliefs could create more division within society. Trust in science and public health measures can help prevent further harm. #"
