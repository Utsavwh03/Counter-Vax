BREAKING NEWS FROM THE UK 😟 😟 😟 : Serious allergic reaction from the Pfizer vaccine ; be careful , be very very careful , this vaccine has been approved a little to quick for my way of thinking . PEOPLE ARE GETTING SICK , seriously sick after being vaccinated 😟 😟 😟

something's fishy with his insistence . i think that vaccine is still on clinical trial and whoever takes that will be sort of a guinea pig . nobody trusts chinese vaccines . i trust the UK vaccine which is still in development . unahin nya sarili nya magvaccine sa september !

@DHSCgovuk @WAPFLondon @MHRAgovuk @OxfordVacGroup @AstraZeneca Duck off with your toxic shot ... You can't catch a virus ! #coronahoax

@NeilDotObrien I'm not a Covid sceptic , Neil . Cheap shot . But I do think that the government is worried about a breakdown of compliance as the vaccine is rolled out and will exaggerate the dangers of variants deliberately . Good click bait headlines . Keep stoking the fear .
4
@JimTimberthing @FatEmperor @cjsnowdon @s8mb @FT One could argue that the lockdown measures & mask mandates have had a greater impact on destroying people's health resulting in an increase in icu numbers . I'm sure its also a coincidence that this new untested vaccine being rolled out in January coincides with the increases .

@runnerosborn You do realise people CANNOT give informed consent because all the facts have not been given , where does it state on this form that the effects on fertility are not know ? You are lying to people is this why pfizer want legal protection ?
6
@CollignonPeter 50 % more people have died from the AZ vaccine in Australia than covid in 2021 Australia should always have set age for AstraZeneca at 60 + or 65 + . You all put money before the health and safety of millions of Australians . The evidence was there and you chose to ignore it
7
@janehansen2000 The second dose is more likely to have noticable effects . Was just with someone who got COVID in the UK and reacted quite badly to her first Pfizer / biontech vaccine - swollen , sore arm & bone ache etc . Probably had plenty of relevant immunity from COVID . 2nd was less bad for her

@Glen_Lurvchild The last time I saw a Dr was in 1993 why will I need a vaccine .. Badlalele kude nami

@ThinkActTank @thisissudheer @asaxena87 @EricTopol @DrEricDing @Covishield Also herd immunity seems to be more of a fantasy when COVID is in question . Even those vaccinated are as susceptible to infection ( different strain ) as the non vaccinated one . The claim that the vaccines decrease the viral symptoms needs more justification

@BusyDrT Not know but hell no . I have suddenly developed allergy to eggs , injectable heavy metals and a few other ingredients I will remember as soon as I see package insert for covid vaccine , just sayin

@CocoMccool @ConceptualJames The AZ vax is much more questionable than the JNJ vaccine , despite being on the same platform JNJ didnt add human - derived sequences to increase the efficacy of their vaccine - - AZ did In terms of safety ( all else equal ) , traditional vax are the least safe and RNA are the safest
14
@BiblicalBeauty The false dichotomy is strong on this one : you either get vaccinated or you believe in the mark of the beast . Maybe , just maybe , I don ’ t inject my body with vaccines that have no long term studies . It ’ s a 3rd way ... surprised Moore doesn ’ t get that 🙄

@vicksiern @Catheri69664306 There has never been a successful Corona virus vacine even though millions have been spent on it , especially after SARS and MERS .

@CappettoJeremy @IOHK_Charles There hasn ’ t been enough time to assess long term effects . Pfizer will monitor test subjects for another two years . Go figure . And they expect people to take the vaccine .

@Biden_Army @Scaramucci @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump @pfizer Great Pfizer is admitting when they fund scientists and universities to do studies it comes w strings to show the results they want ...
