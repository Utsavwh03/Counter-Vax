( After equally advanced countries with critical - independent - not Govt pressured - research technologies confirm . PE ) "" Oxford AstraZeneca COVID - 19 Vaccine Trial on Children Paused While UK Investigates Blood Clots in Adults "" https://t.co/LAF7k086l1

","The pause on the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine trial for children was a precautionary measure taken to investigate reports of rare blood clots in adults. This is a standard process in vaccine development to ensure safety, not a condemnation of the vaccine’s efficacy. Many other vaccines have undergone similar scrutiny and have been deemed safe for use. It’s important to rely on the guidance of health authorities and independent research rather than isolated incidents. Vaccination remains a critical tool in controlling the pandemic and protecting public health."

@MarciHunni @paulo1141 @thehill The Flu kills more and we have a vaccine that we create every year and it still kills more ppl every year . There is nothing to stop a virus . It has to burn out and run it course . At least with Covid we can use HCQ , Z - Pack , and zinc . The FLU has nothing . Cont .

","A quick rebuttal could be: 

""While it's true the flu can be deadly, vaccines significantly reduce its severity and transmission. COVID-19 vaccines also provide critical protection against severe illness and death, and we have evidence of their effectiveness. Relying solely on treatments like HCQ and zinc is not a substitute for prevention through vaccination."""

UK wake up now ! We are just #human stock to #cabal #elites #tories We are treated like sheep with an evil shepherd . Say no to #SocialDistancing #masks #vaccines It is time to protest & rise in large numbers . We unite , we are strong . #WednesdayVibes #Covid_19 #COVIDIOTS are right !

","A quick rebuttal could be: ""It's important to rely on science and expert advice when it comes to public health. Vaccines have been proven to save lives and reduce the spread of COVID-19. While protests are a way to express views, spreading misinformation can harm communities. Let's prioritize facts and collective well-being."""

Agreed ! As reports surfaced Wednesday of yet another healthcare worker who suffered a severe allergic reaction to #Pfizer ’ s #COVID #vaccine , it ’ s time the #FDA and #Fauci explain what they plan to do about it . #TheDefender https://t.co/u6eUtOhTok

","While it's unfortunate that some individuals may experience allergic reactions to vaccines, it's important to note that such events are rare and typically manageable. The benefits of COVID-19 vaccination—such as preventing severe illness and saving lives—outweigh these risks. Regulatory agencies like the FDA continuously monitor vaccine safety, and the overall data supports the vaccines' effectiveness and safety for the vast majority of people."

@GeraldKutney @drdavidsamadi Let ’ s wear masks and shut down the economy until all obese people are fit and thin or until they can get their asses jabbed with the Gates / Fauci Chinese Virus Vaccine ! Is that what we should do ?

","A quick rebuttal could be:

""The comparison is flawed. Vaccines are proven scientifically to prevent serious diseases, benefitting public health. Addressing obesity requires different strategies and is not the same as immunization. Public health measures like vaccination save lives and protect communities, regardless of individual health conditions."""
