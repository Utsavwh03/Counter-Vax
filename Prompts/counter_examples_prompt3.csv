( After equally advanced countries with critical - independent - not Govt pressured - research technologies confirm . PE ) "" Oxford AstraZeneca COVID - 19 Vaccine Trial on Children Paused While UK Investigates Blood Clots in Adults "" https://t.co/LAF7k086l1

","While it is true that clinical trials for vaccines, including the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, were paused to investigate safety concerns, this process reflects the rigorous safety protocols that are essential for vaccine administration. Independent health agencies, including the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), continuously evaluate data to ensure that the benefits of vaccination outweigh any potential risks. Pausing trials for investigation is a standard practice in clinical research aimed at ensuring public safety, rather than an indication of the vaccine's ineffectiveness. Moreover, numerous studies have shown that vaccines play a critical role in controlling the spread of COVID-19 and reducing severe cases and hospitalizations."

@MarciHunni @paulo1141 @thehill The Flu kills more and we have a vaccine that we create every year and it still kills more ppl every year . There is nothing to stop a virus . It has to burn out and run it course . At least with Covid we can use HCQ , Z - Pack , and zinc . The FLU has nothing . Cont .

","While it's true that both the flu and COVID-19 can be serious, it's important to recognize that we have a flu vaccine, which significantly reduces the incidence and severity of flu infections each year. Additionally, COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to greatly reduce hospitalization and death rates, providing a crucial layer of protection. Relying solely on treatments like HCQ and zinc is not a comprehensive strategy, as these have uncertain efficacy and the best approach is to prevent infections through vaccination. Vaccination not only protects individuals but also helps to build herd immunity, reducing the overall spread of the virus."

UK wake up now ! We are just #human stock to #cabal #elites #tories We are treated like sheep with an evil shepherd . Say no to #SocialDistancing #masks #vaccines It is time to protest & rise in large numbers . We unite , we are strong . #WednesdayVibes #Covid_19 #COVIDIOTS are right !

","While it's essential to advocate for personal freedoms and question government actions, the overwhelming consensus among scientists and public health experts is that vaccines are a crucial tool in controlling the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19. Vaccines save lives and protect vulnerable populations. Social distancing and mask-wearing are proven methods to reduce transmission, especially in the absence of widespread vaccination. Engaging in informed dialogue and considering expert advice can lead to safer communities rather than viewing health measures as oppressive."

Agreed ! As reports surfaced Wednesday of yet another healthcare worker who suffered a severe allergic reaction to #Pfizer ’ s #COVID #vaccine , it ’ s time the #FDA and #Fauci explain what they plan to do about it . #TheDefender https://t.co/u6eUtOhTok

","While reports of allergic reactions to vaccines, including the Pfizer COVID vaccine, are concerning, it's important to consider that such reactions are extremely rare compared to the millions of vaccine doses administered. The benefits of vaccination—reducing the risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19—outweigh these risks for the vast majority of the population. Additionally, health authorities like the FDA continually monitor vaccine safety and provide guidance to manage and mitigate any potential adverse effects. Overall, the evidence supports the safety and efficacy of vaccines in controlling the pandemic."

@GeraldKutney @drdavidsamadi Let ’ s wear masks and shut down the economy until all obese people are fit and thin or until they can get their asses jabbed with the Gates / Fauci Chinese Virus Vaccine ! Is that what we should do ?

","The statement seems to conflate obesity with vaccine hesitancy and public health measures, but it's important to recognize that the two issues are distinct. Public health measures like mask-wearing and vaccination are essential for protecting the entire community from contagious diseases, regardless of individual health conditions. Instead of comparing weight loss to vaccination, it would be more productive to focus on promoting healthy choices for all while ensuring equitable access to vaccines, which are crucial for controlling the spread of viruses and safeguarding public health."
