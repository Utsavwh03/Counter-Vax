@CNN Nobody is going to take the stupid vaccine ! No health worker will be force to take it either . The biggest Eruption of the health industry is forcing workers to take Bad unproven vaccine that could Fu * k up many lives forever . I would rather have covid again , than to take a vaccine

","It's important to rely on scientific evidence and expert consensus rather than fear. Vaccines undergo rigorous testing for safety and efficacy, and widespread vaccination is key to controlling COVID-19. Choosing not to vaccinate not only risks your health but also the health of those around you."

@JaroGiesbrecht @charlesadler @kinsellawarren The are also going to approve the AstraZeneca vaccine even though it's still being tested for efficacy . Thanks I'll wait even though I'm in my 80 ' s and immune compromised . I want to know whatever I'm taking is safe and effective

","While it's essential to prioritize safety and efficacy, it's important to recognize that emergency use authorizations are based on rigorous data and expert reviews. The benefits of vaccination, especially for those in high-risk groups, often outweigh the risks. Waiting for complete approval could delay protection against serious illness."

@MattHancock @MHRAgovuk @pfizer @BioNTech_Group Why has it been granted that they are exempt from any issues arising from taking the vaccine ? If it is 100 % safe and has been properly tested then surely this isn't necessary

","While vaccines undergo rigorous testing, no medical intervention is completely without risk. Liability protection encourages rapid development and availability, especially during emergencies, allowing companies to focus on safety and efficacy rather than legal concerns."

“ They ’ re gonna come up w / a vaccine & in that vaccine , everybody is gonna have to take it … & inside of that vaccine there ’ s going to be some type of electronic computer device that ’ s gonna put some type of chip in you & maybe even have some mood , mind - altering circumstances , ”

","This sounds like a conspiracy theory rather than fact. Vaccines are rigorously tested for safety and efficacy, and there's no credible evidence to support the idea of microchips or mind-altering substances in them. It's important to rely on proven science rather than fear-based speculation."

@BallouxFrancois Without Phase 3 safety and efficacy data the Russian vaccine is a none starter outside Russia . That ’ s how the system works

","While Phase 3 data is crucial, dismissing the Russian vaccine outright might overlook its potential benefits, especially in urgent scenarios. Access to vaccines should be based on comprehensive evaluation, not just the origin or phase of trials."

@allancarr3192 @jennyfaebelfast @Pfizer_UK In Argentina for a couple of years there is no passport , driving license , education or health care without vaccination . This has all been planned for a long time . Evil .

","Your claim about Argentina's policies lacks context; the measures were implemented to ensure public health and safety amid a pandemic, not as part of a sinister plot. Vaccination requirements are common for accessing certain services worldwide."

@edstetzer Ed , to be fair , we all know it's only the Russian vaccine that ends up tattooing 666 on one's forehead . You know , Gog and Magog and all that , which , in translation is ( I'm told ) , "" Gates and Putin for the Win ! ""

",This sounds like a stretch. Associating a vaccine with conspiracy theories undermines public health discussions. Let’s focus on facts and evidence rather than unfounded claims.

@realDonaldTrump ... His role in Moderna is where he made his fortune and established his connections . Let that sink in . Wake up people ! You are being conditioned and controlled . Please copy and paste this , I did !

",Correlation doesn’t imply causation. Just because someone has ties to a company doesn’t mean they control or manipulate the situation. Let’s focus on facts rather than speculation.

Do you honestly believe that people accept what you are doing and saying with your killer vaccine and your Nazi Style vaccine passport , do everyone a favour and quit . Winston Churchill will be turning in his grave . @BorisJohnson TIME TO END THIS HOAX #fakepandemic

","This tweet misrepresents public health initiatives and spreads misinformation. Vaccines have been proven to save lives and reduce transmission. Historical comparisons to Nazis undermine the seriousness of real atrocities. Constructive dialogue is crucial, not fear-mongering."

Fall 2021 : Somehow , the latest COVID vaccine has caused the zombie apocalypse . Terror reigns in the streets ! Cancers : https://t.co/z9n9B2KuJ9

","This seems exaggerative and unfounded. The COVID vaccine is designed to save lives, not cause chaos. Let's focus on facts and science rather than sensationalism and misinformation."

@ElContador2000 @DebraClaridge Foetal material , mercury , an isolated strand of RNA to produce covid spike protein , quantum dot any or all of these . We don't need a vaccine cultured antibody cells worked .

","While it's important to question vaccine ingredients and methods, claims like ""foetal material"" and ""mercury"" are misleading or exaggerated. Vaccines undergo rigorous testing and are crucial for public health. Cultured antibody cells are not a substitute for widespread vaccination, which helps achieve herd immunity and protect vulnerable populations. Let's focus on facts rather than conspiracy theories."

","While it’s important to scrutinize any corporation's history, dismissing the efficacy and safety of vaccines based on past actions overlooks the rigorous testing and regulatory processes in place. Scientific consensus supports the benefits of vaccination in controlling diseases, including COVID-19. Let’s focus on evidence rather than fear."

Halt ! ! Volunteer in the U . K . trial got transverse myelitis inflammatory syndrome affects spinal cord sparked by viral infections AstraZeneca ’ s vaccine relies on a chimpanzee adenovirus modified to carry coronavirus genes and deliver them into human cells . https://t.co/3qrtra9uxd

","This tweet misrepresents the situation. While there are reports of adverse events like transverse myelitis, it's crucial to understand that such cases are extremely rare compared to the millions vaccinated. The benefits of vaccination, including preventing severe disease and death, far outweigh these isolated incidents. Relying on accurate and comprehensive data is key to understanding vaccine safety."

I will take the vaccine if it ever gets down to nobodies like me , but only if it's Pfizer or Moderna , not Astrazeneca . They are not made the same , and I think Astrazeneca is inferior in safety and efficacy .

","While it's understandable to have preferences based on perceptions of safety and efficacy, it's important to remember that all vaccines authorized for use have undergone rigorous testing and have been shown to be effective in preventing severe illness. AstraZeneca has been used globally with a strong safety profile. Choosing to get vaccinated sooner, regardless of the brand, can provide critical protection for you and those around you."

@oldivory I was wondering about that , too ! My mom died of a bad reaction to the regular flu shot , so I'm a little reluctant to take a chance . Also , Pfizer is a major donor to Republicans , so not exactly a vote in their favor .

","While it's understandable to feel hesitant after a personal loss, it's important to consider that serious reactions to vaccines are extremely rare. Prioritizing broad public health measures and evidence-based practices can ultimately save more lives. As for political donations, it's crucial to focus on the science and efficacy of a vaccine rather than its backers."
