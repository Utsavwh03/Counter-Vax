@CNN Nobody is going to take the stupid vaccine ! No health worker will be force to take it either . The biggest Eruption of the health industry is forcing workers to take Bad unproven vaccine that could Fu * k up many lives forever . I would rather have covid again , than to take a vaccine

","While it's understandable to have concerns about vaccines, it's important to recognize that COVID-19 vaccines have undergone rigorous testing and have been proven safe and effective in preventing severe illness and death. Many health organizations, including the CDC and WHO, endorse vaccination as a crucial tool in combating the pandemic. The risks associated with COVID-19 far outweigh the potential side effects of the vaccine, and vaccination not only protects individuals but also helps safeguard the community. Choosing vaccination is a proactive step towards ending the pandemic and returning to normal life."

@JaroGiesbrecht @charlesadler @kinsellawarren The are also going to approve the AstraZeneca vaccine even though it's still being tested for efficacy . Thanks I'll wait even though I'm in my 80 ' s and immune compromised . I want to know whatever I'm taking is safe and effective

","It's understandable to prioritize safety, especially for those who are older and immunocompromised. However, it's important to note that all vaccines, including AstraZeneca, undergo rigorous clinical trials to assess their safety and efficacy before receiving approval from health authorities. Real-world data from many countries show that the benefits of vaccination in preventing severe illness far outweigh the risks, especially for vulnerable populations. Waiting for trial completions could leave you at greater risk of severe COVID-19 complications. Vaccination is a key tool in protecting your health."

@MattHancock @MHRAgovuk @pfizer @BioNTech_Group Why has it been granted that they are exempt from any issues arising from taking the vaccine ? If it is 100 % safe and has been properly tested then surely this isn't necessary

","A quick rebuttal could be: ""Vaccines undergo extensive testing for safety and efficacy before approval. The exemptions protect against rare adverse events that can occur despite rigorous testing. This does not imply that vaccines are unsafe, but rather acknowledges the complexity of medical liability in a rapidly evolving public health landscape."""

","A quick rebuttal to this tweet could be: 

""Vaccines are thoroughly tested for safety and efficacy before approval. Claims about microchips and mind control are unfounded conspiracy theories with no scientific basis. Vaccination is about protecting public health, not tracking or altering individuals. Trust the science."""

@BallouxFrancois Without Phase 3 safety and efficacy data the Russian vaccine is a none starter outside Russia . That ’ s how the system works

","While it's true that Phase 3 data is crucial for vaccine approval, it's important to recognize that the Russian vaccine, like many others, has undergone evaluations to receive emergency use authorization. Additionally, different regulatory bodies may assess vaccines differently. It's also worth considering that some countries have opted to use the vaccine based on available data and public health needs, indicating a level of trust in the existing evidence."

@allancarr3192 @jennyfaebelfast @Pfizer_UK In Argentina for a couple of years there is no passport , driving license , education or health care without vaccination . This has all been planned for a long time . Evil .

","A quick rebuttal could state: ""The requirement for vaccinations in Argentina is based on public health measures to protect the community. Vaccines have proven effective in preventing serious diseases, and such policies aim to ensure safety and well-being, not to impose control. Misinformation can undermine public health efforts."""

@edstetzer Ed , to be fair , we all know it's only the Russian vaccine that ends up tattooing 666 on one's forehead . You know , Gog and Magog and all that , which , in translation is ( I'm told ) , "" Gates and Putin for the Win ! ""

","While humor can keep conversations light, it's important to clarify that vaccines undergo extensive testing for safety and efficacy, regardless of their origin. Claims linking vaccines to tattoos or conspiracies like ""666"" are unfounded and detract from the critical public health benefits vaccines provide. Spreading misinformation only hinders our ability to combat preventable diseases. Let's focus on facts and science rather than conspiracy theories."

","A quick rebuttal could be: ""It's important to critically evaluate claims about individuals and their connections. Trump's financial interests could be coincidental, and vaccines have undergone rigorous testing and approval processes. Misinformation can undermine public health efforts. Let's focus on facts and science instead."""

","A quick rebuttal could be: ""It's important to base our beliefs on facts, not fear. Vaccines have been proven to reduce illness and save lives during pandemics. The comparison to Nazi policies is inappropriate and undermines real historical suffering. Let's rely on science and support health measures that protect our communities."""

Fall 2021 : Somehow , the latest COVID vaccine has caused the zombie apocalypse . Terror reigns in the streets ! Cancers : https://t.co/z9n9B2KuJ9

","Rebuttal: The claim linking COVID vaccines to a ""zombie apocalypse"" is baseless and sensational. Vaccines are rigorously tested for safety and efficacy. While side effects can occur, they are typically minor compared to the benefits of preventing severe illness and death from COVID-19. Misinformation only undermines public health efforts. Let's focus on the facts—vaccination saves lives."

@ElContador2000 @DebraClaridge Foetal material , mercury , an isolated strand of RNA to produce covid spike protein , quantum dot any or all of these . We don't need a vaccine cultured antibody cells worked .

","A quick rebuttal could be: ""Vaccines undergo rigorous testing to ensure safety and efficacy, and claims about fetal material, mercury, or quantum dots are often misleading. The mRNA in COVID vaccines does not contain live virus and is designed to stimulate an immune response without causing disease. Vaccines have been proven effective in preventing severe illness, and public health experts recommend them as a crucial tool in controlling the pandemic."""

","While it's important to acknowledge Pfizer's past issues, the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines have been rigorously evaluated in extensive clinical trials and have received approval from multiple health authorities worldwide. Vaccines are a crucial tool in combating the pandemic, and their benefits far outweigh the historical misconduct of pharmaceutical companies. Public health decisions should be based on current scientific evidence, not past actions."

Halt ! ! Volunteer in the U . K . trial got transverse myelitis inflammatory syndrome affects spinal cord sparked by viral infections AstraZeneca ’ s vaccine relies on a chimpanzee adenovirus modified to carry coronavirus genes and deliver them into human cells . https://t.co/3qrtra9uxd

","While the tweet mentions a reported case of transverse myelitis in a trial volunteer, it's important to highlight that such cases are rare and not necessarily caused by the vaccine itself. Clinical trials are designed to monitor and evaluate such events carefully. Furthermore, extensive studies have shown that the benefits of vaccination in preventing severe illness from COVID-19 far outweigh the risks associated with potential side effects. Vaccines undergo rigorous testing to ensure safety and efficacy before being approved for public use."

I will take the vaccine if it ever gets down to nobodies like me , but only if it's Pfizer or Moderna , not Astrazeneca . They are not made the same , and I think Astrazeneca is inferior in safety and efficacy .

","While it's understandable to have preferences based on personal research, it's important to note that the AstraZeneca vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective in large clinical trials. Regulatory agencies like the WHO and CDC have endorsed its use, and it plays a vital role in global vaccination efforts, particularly in lower-income countries. All authorized vaccines, including AstraZeneca, contribute to controlling the pandemic and protecting public health."

@oldivory I was wondering about that , too ! My mom died of a bad reaction to the regular flu shot , so I'm a little reluctant to take a chance . Also , Pfizer is a major donor to Republicans , so not exactly a vote in their favor .

","It's important to remember that while adverse reactions can occur with any vaccine, serious side effects from vaccines like the flu shot are extremely rare. The benefits of vaccination, including protection against severe illness, far outweigh the risks for most people. Additionally, vaccine development and approval processes are rigorous and prioritize safety. As for the political donations, it's worth noting that the effectiveness and safety of vaccines are determined by scientific evidence, not political affiliations. It's crucial to consult with healthcare professionals and rely on credible sources when making decisions about vaccinations."
