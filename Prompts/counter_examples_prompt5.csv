( After equally advanced countries with critical - independent - not Govt pressured - research technologies confirm . PE ) "" Oxford AstraZeneca COVID - 19 Vaccine Trial on Children Paused While UK Investigates Blood Clots in Adults "" https://t.co/LAF7k086l1

","The tweet implies skepticism about the safety of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine based on an isolated incident of blood clots. However, it's important to note that the pause in the trial was a precautionary measure rather than an indication of ineffectiveness or systemic risk. Regulatory bodies continuously monitor vaccine safety, and adverse effects are common in clinical trials. The benefits of widespread vaccination, as demonstrated by numerous studies, outweigh the risks, especially given the severity of COVID-19. Independent research has consistently upheld the vaccine's efficacy in preventing serious illness. Thus, halting a trial for investigation is a standard, safety-first protocol that underscores scientific integrity."

@MarciHunni @paulo1141 @thehill The Flu kills more and we have a vaccine that we create every year and it still kills more ppl every year . There is nothing to stop a virus . It has to burn out and run it course . At least with Covid we can use HCQ , Z - Pack , and zinc . The FLU has nothing . Cont .

","While it's true that the flu causes significant annual deaths and vaccines are developed each year, it's essential to recognize the unique and severe impact COVID-19 has had globally. COVID-19 is more contagious and has led to higher mortality rates, overwhelming healthcare systems and necessitating stringent public health measures. Additionally, the claim about HCQ and other treatments lacks robust scientific backing, as studies have shown limited efficacy. Rather than downplaying the threat of COVID-19, we should prioritize comprehensive vaccination and public health strategies to mitigate its spread and protect vulnerable populations."

UK wake up now ! We are just #human stock to #cabal #elites #tories We are treated like sheep with an evil shepherd . Say no to #SocialDistancing #masks #vaccines It is time to protest & rise in large numbers . We unite , we are strong . #WednesdayVibes #Covid_19 #COVIDIOTS are right !

","While it's important to question authority and advocate for personal freedoms, dismissing public health measures like social distancing, masks, and vaccines can undermine efforts to protect vulnerable populations. The scientific consensus supports these measures as effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19 and saving lives. Instead of viewing public health initiatives as oppression, we should recognize them as collective efforts to safeguard community health and well-being during a global crisis. Protests should focus on constructive dialogue rather than rejecting science and endangering others."

Agreed ! As reports surfaced Wednesday of yet another healthcare worker who suffered a severe allergic reaction to #Pfizer ’ s #COVID #vaccine , it ’ s time the #FDA and #Fauci explain what they plan to do about it . #TheDefender https://t.co/u6eUtOhTok

","While it's important to investigate any reported adverse reactions to vaccines, it's crucial to understand that severe allergic reactions are extremely rare. The benefits of COVID-19 vaccines, including preventing severe illness and saving lives, far outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people. The FDA and healthcare experts continuously monitor vaccine safety and take appropriate actions when necessary. Focusing on isolated incidents without the broader context can create unnecessary fear and undermine public trust in vital vaccination efforts."

@GeraldKutney @drdavidsamadi Let ’ s wear masks and shut down the economy until all obese people are fit and thin or until they can get their asses jabbed with the Gates / Fauci Chinese Virus Vaccine ! Is that what we should do ?

","The argument presented ignores the fact that public health measures, such as mask-wearing or lockdowns, are aimed at protecting entire communities, not just individuals. The focus should be on creating accessible resources for health and wellness rather than shaming or targeting specific groups. Additionally, vaccines and public health strategies are evidence-based responses to a pandemic, grounded in science, rather than a means of personal judgment or coercion. Prioritizing compassionate and inclusive health initiatives fosters better outcomes for everyone."
