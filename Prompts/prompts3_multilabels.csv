@CNN Nobody is going to take the stupid vaccine ! No health worker will be force to take it either . The biggest Eruption of the health industry is forcing workers to take Bad unproven vaccine that could Fu * k up many lives forever . I would rather have covid again , than to take a vaccine

","While it's important to respect individual opinions on vaccines, the overwhelming consensus among healthcare professionals and public health organizations is that vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, have undergone rigorous testing for safety and efficacy. Studies have shown that these vaccines significantly reduce the risk of severe illness and complications from COVID-19. The benefits of vaccination, such as protecting not only oneself but also vulnerable populations, outweigh the potential risks. Additionally, choosing to contract COVID-19 can lead to severe health consequences, long-term effects, and even death, which are not present with vaccination."

@JaroGiesbrecht @charlesadler @kinsellawarren The are also going to approve the AstraZeneca vaccine even though it's still being tested for efficacy . Thanks I'll wait even though I'm in my 80 ' s and immune compromised . I want to know whatever I'm taking is safe and effective

","While it's understandable to want thorough testing for safety and efficacy, it's important to note that the AstraZeneca vaccine, like others, has undergone extensive trials and regulatory review processes before receiving emergency use authorization. Regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and WHO, have assessed the data from these trials, which show that the benefits of vaccination in preventing severe illness and hospitalization far outweigh potential risks, especially for vulnerable populations. Vaccination can provide critical protection for individuals who are immune compromised, and waiting too long to get vaccinated could expose them to higher risks of serious illness from COVID-19."

@MattHancock @MHRAgovuk @pfizer @BioNTech_Group Why has it been granted that they are exempt from any issues arising from taking the vaccine ? If it is 100 % safe and has been properly tested then surely this isn't necessary

","While concerns about vaccine safety and liability are understandable, it's important to note that no vaccine, including those developed for COVID-19, is deemed 100% safe. All medical interventions carry some level of risk. The liability exemptions for vaccine manufacturers are intended to ensure that they can respond quickly to public health emergencies and encourage innovation in vaccine development. Additionally, rigorous clinical trials and ongoing monitoring help ensure that vaccines are as safe as possible. The benefits of vaccination in preventing severe illness and death during a pandemic significantly outweigh the risks for the vast majority of the population."

“ They ’ re gonna come up w / a vaccine & in that vaccine , everybody is gonna have to take it … & inside of that vaccine there ’ s going to be some type of electronic computer device that ’ s gonna put some type of chip in you & maybe even have some mood , mind - altering circumstances , ”

","The claim that vaccines contain electronic devices or chips lacks scientific evidence and is based on misunderstandings of how vaccines work. Vaccines are designed to stimulate the immune system to build protection against diseases, not to alter thoughts or control minds. Regulatory agencies rigorously test vaccines for safety and efficacy before they are approved for public use, ensuring that they are both effective and safe for individuals. Spreading unfounded fears can harm public health efforts and hinder progress in preventing infectious diseases."

@BallouxFrancois Without Phase 3 safety and efficacy data the Russian vaccine is a none starter outside Russia . That ’ s how the system works

","While Phase 3 trials are a crucial component of vaccine development, the urgent nature of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the use of alternative data sources for evaluating vaccine safety and efficacy. Real-world evidence and post-marketing surveillance can provide valuable insights into a vaccine's performance outside of controlled trial conditions. Additionally, some countries have opted for accelerated approval processes to address public health needs, which can be justified in the face of a global health crisis."

@allancarr3192 @jennyfaebelfast @Pfizer_UK In Argentina for a couple of years there is no passport , driving license , education or health care without vaccination . This has all been planned for a long time . Evil .

","The measures requiring vaccination for access to certain services in Argentina are designed to protect public health and prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Vaccination has been shown to significantly reduce illness and mortality rates, and such policies aim to create a safer environment for everyone, especially vulnerable populations. Furthermore, these measures reflect a public health strategy rather than a conspiracy; they are implemented with the goal of achieving community immunity and safeguarding public health, not a form of control."

@edstetzer Ed , to be fair , we all know it's only the Russian vaccine that ends up tattooing 666 on one's forehead . You know , Gog and Magog and all that , which , in translation is ( I'm told ) , "" Gates and Putin for the Win ! ""

","While the tweet presents a humorous take on conspiracy theories surrounding vaccines, it's important to recognize that vaccines, including those developed by various countries, are thoroughly tested for safety and efficacy. Scientific consensus supports vaccination as a critical public health measure for preventing infectious diseases, and there is no credible evidence linking vaccines to tattoos or numbers like ""666."" Relying on satire to undermine vital healthcare advancements can lead to misinformation and decreased public trust in vaccines, which ultimately jeopardizes community health."

@realDonaldTrump ... His role in Moderna is where he made his fortune and established his connections . Let that sink in . Wake up people ! You are being conditioned and controlled . Please copy and paste this , I did !

","While it's important to scrutinize the relationships between pharmaceutical companies and public figures, it's equally crucial to acknowledge the extensive research and rigorous testing involved in vaccine development. Vaccines have historically proven to be effective in preventing diseases and saving lives. Misinformation can undermine public health efforts and lead to harmful consequences. It's essential to base our beliefs on solid evidence rather than speculation."

Do you honestly believe that people accept what you are doing and saying with your killer vaccine and your Nazi Style vaccine passport , do everyone a favour and quit . Winston Churchill will be turning in his grave . @BorisJohnson TIME TO END THIS HOAX #fakepandemic

","It's important to recognize that vaccines have been shown through extensive research and clinical trials to significantly reduce the risk of severe illness and death from infectious diseases. The comparison to totalitarian regimes like the Nazis is both misleading and insensitive, as it undermines the seriousness of actual historical atrocities. Vaccine passports are implemented in many countries to protect public health and facilitate safe travel and gatherings. Engaging in constructive dialogue about vaccine safety and efficacy can foster understanding, rather than perpetuating fear and misinformation."

Fall 2021 : Somehow , the latest COVID vaccine has caused the zombie apocalypse . Terror reigns in the streets ! Cancers : https://t.co/z9n9B2KuJ9

","The claim that the COVID vaccine caused a ""zombie apocalypse"" is a hyperbolic exaggeration with no basis in reality. Vaccines undergo rigorous testing and monitoring to ensure their safety and efficacy. Additionally, the rise of cancer cases is primarily attributed to a variety of factors including environmental influences, lifestyle choices, and genetics rather than vaccination. Spreading fear through misinformation undermines public health efforts and can prevent people from making informed decisions about vaccination, which is crucial for controlling the spread of diseases."

@ElContador2000 @DebraClaridge Foetal material , mercury , an isolated strand of RNA to produce covid spike protein , quantum dot any or all of these . We don't need a vaccine cultured antibody cells worked .

","While concerns about vaccine ingredients and their safety are understandable, extensive research and regulatory oversight demonstrate that vaccines are safe and effective. Vaccines do not contain harmful levels of mercury, and the use of fetal cell lines in research does not imply the presence of fetal material in the final product. Additionally, vaccines work by training the immune system without the risk of severe disease that actual infections pose. Cultured antibody cells alone cannot provide the wide-ranging immunity that vaccines effectively stimulate across the population."

","While it’s important to scrutinize pharmaceutical companies for their past actions, the rigorous approval process of vaccines involves extensive testing and oversight by multiple regulatory agencies, including the FDA and WHO. These independent bodies evaluate the safety and efficacy of vaccines based on scientific evidence, not solely on the reputation of the companies producing them. The overwhelming consensus among medical experts is that vaccines, including those from Pfizer, have significantly reduced the severity of COVID-19 and its spread, ultimately saving countless lives."

Halt ! ! Volunteer in the U . K . trial got transverse myelitis inflammatory syndrome affects spinal cord sparked by viral infections AstraZeneca ’ s vaccine relies on a chimpanzee adenovirus modified to carry coronavirus genes and deliver them into human cells . https://t.co/3qrtra9uxd

","While it's true that some individuals in clinical trials can experience adverse effects, including conditions like transverse myelitis, it's important to consider the broader context. The incidence of such adverse effects is extremely rare compared to the millions of vaccine doses administered successfully. Additionally, vaccines undergo rigorous testing for safety and efficacy before approval, and the benefits of vaccination in preventing serious illness from COVID-19 far outweigh these rare risks. Public health authorities continually monitor vaccine safety data, ensuring that the overall safety profile remains favorable."

I will take the vaccine if it ever gets down to nobodies like me , but only if it's Pfizer or Moderna , not Astrazeneca . They are not made the same , and I think Astrazeneca is inferior in safety and efficacy .

","It's important to understand that all vaccines authorized for emergency use, including AstraZeneca, have undergone rigorous testing and have been shown to be safe and effective in preventing COVID-19. Regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and WHO, evaluate vaccines based on extensive clinical trial data, not brand perception. While personal preferences are valid, choosing a vaccine should be guided by scientific evidence and public health recommendations rather than brand bias. All vaccines play a crucial role in controlling the pandemic and protecting the community."

@oldivory I was wondering about that , too ! My mom died of a bad reaction to the regular flu shot , so I'm a little reluctant to take a chance . Also , Pfizer is a major donor to Republicans , so not exactly a vote in their favor .

","It's important to acknowledge personal experiences with medical interventions, but it's also crucial to consider the broader context of vaccine safety. While serious reactions can occur, they are extremely rare, and the benefits of vaccination in preventing severe disease and complications are well documented. Additionally, the relationship between pharmaceutical companies and political contributions does not negate the extensive research and rigorous testing that vaccines undergo to ensure public safety. Vaccination remains a key tool in protecting not just individual health, but also community health."
