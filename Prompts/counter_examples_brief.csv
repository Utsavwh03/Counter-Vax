( After equally advanced countries with critical - independent - not Govt pressured - research technologies confirm . PE ) "" Oxford AstraZeneca COVID - 19 Vaccine Trial on Children Paused While UK Investigates Blood Clots in Adults "" https://t.co/LAF7k086l1

","While concerns about vaccine safety are important and should be thoroughly investigated, it is crucial to recognize that paused trials are a standard part of the research process, especially in large-scale studies involving vaccines. The decision to pause the Oxford AstraZeneca trial was made as a precautionary measure to assess the rare instances of blood clots, not as an indication that the vaccine is unsafe for the general population. Independent committees of experts review data carefully, and the overall benefits of vaccination in preventing severe illness and death from COVID-19 far outweigh the risks associated with rare side effects. Additionally, vaccines undergo rigorous testing and monitoring even after approval to ensure their continued safety. Critical thinking and reliance on science-based evidence should guide our decisions, rather than anecdotal reports or isolated incidents."

@MarciHunni @paulo1141 @thehill The Flu kills more and we have a vaccine that we create every year and it still kills more ppl every year . There is nothing to stop a virus . It has to burn out and run it course . At least with Covid we can use HCQ , Z - Pack , and zinc . The FLU has nothing . Cont .

","While it’s true that the flu can be deadly and that vaccines are reformulated annually, the argument overlooks the overwhelming evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of vaccines in preventing severe illness and death from various viruses, including COVID-19. Vaccines not only reduce the severity and spread of disease but also protect vulnerable populations who cannot be vaccinated. Relying solely on treatments like HCQ, Z-Pak, and zinc can be misleading, as they are not universally effective and do not prevent infection. Public health measures, including vaccines, are crucial in controlling outbreaks and reducing mortality. The experience with COVID-19 highlights the need for proactive vaccination strategies, rather than assuming that a virus will merely ""burn out."""

UK wake up now ! We are just #human stock to #cabal #elites #tories We are treated like sheep with an evil shepherd . Say no to #SocialDistancing #masks #vaccines It is time to protest & rise in large numbers . We unite , we are strong . #WednesdayVibes #Covid_19 #COVIDIOTS are right !

","While the sentiment of questioning authority is important, the assertion that vaccines are part of a conspiracy undermines the overwhelming scientific consensus on their safety and efficacy. Vaccines have been proven to save lives and prevent the spread of diseases. Social distancing and masks are public health measures designed to protect vulnerable populations. Instead of protesting, it’s vital to engage in informed discussions about health to ensure our collective well-being and safeguard our communities. Unity should be about supporting each other through science-based solutions, not rejecting them."

Agreed ! As reports surfaced Wednesday of yet another healthcare worker who suffered a severe allergic reaction to #Pfizer ’ s #COVID #vaccine , it ’ s time the #FDA and #Fauci explain what they plan to do about it . #TheDefender https://t.co/u6eUtOhTok

","While it's important to acknowledge adverse reactions to vaccines, it's crucial to put these instances in context. The vast majority of vaccine recipients experience only mild or no side effects. Health authorities, including the FDA, closely monitor vaccine safety and have established protocols for managing allergic reactions. The benefits of COVID-19 vaccination in preventing serious illness, hospitalization, and death significantly outweigh the risks for most individuals. Additionally, severe allergic reactions are rare, and those who are at risk can consult healthcare professionals for personalized advice. The overall evidence supports the continued use of vaccines as a vital tool in controlling the pandemic."

@GeraldKutney @drdavidsamadi Let ’ s wear masks and shut down the economy until all obese people are fit and thin or until they can get their asses jabbed with the Gates / Fauci Chinese Virus Vaccine ! Is that what we should do ?

","The argument presented in the tweet overlooks the complexity of public health measures and the role of vaccines. Vaccines have been proven to significantly reduce the spread of infectious diseases, protect vulnerable populations, and prevent severe illness and death. Unlike obesity, which is influenced by a myriad of factors including genetics and socio-economic status, infectious diseases can spread rapidly and indiscriminately, making vaccination a crucial tool for community health. Public health measures, such as vaccinations, are not about blaming individuals but rather about protecting the collective well-being of society and ensuring that healthcare systems are not overwhelmed. Balancing personal health choices with community health responsibilities is essential for a resilient and thriving society."
