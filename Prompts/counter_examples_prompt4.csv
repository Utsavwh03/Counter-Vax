( After equally advanced countries with critical - independent - not Govt pressured - research technologies confirm . PE ) "" Oxford AstraZeneca COVID - 19 Vaccine Trial on Children Paused While UK Investigates Blood Clots in Adults "" https://t.co/LAF7k086l1

","While it's important to investigate any adverse effects, pausing trials doesn’t necessarily indicate failure or danger. It's a standard precaution, reflecting the rigorous safety protocols in place, not a condemnation of the vaccine's overall effectiveness or safety."

@MarciHunni @paulo1141 @thehill The Flu kills more and we have a vaccine that we create every year and it still kills more ppl every year . There is nothing to stop a virus . It has to burn out and run it course . At least with Covid we can use HCQ , Z - Pack , and zinc . The FLU has nothing . Cont .

","While flu vaccines aren't perfect, they significantly reduce severe cases and deaths. Equating the flu and COVID-19 overlooks COVID's unique risks and impacts, including long-term complications. Relying on unproven treatments like HCQ detracts from effective prevention and vaccines. Let's focus on what's scientifically validated."

UK wake up now ! We are just #human stock to #cabal #elites #tories We are treated like sheep with an evil shepherd . Say no to #SocialDistancing #masks #vaccines It is time to protest & rise in large numbers . We unite , we are strong . #WednesdayVibes #Covid_19 #COVIDIOTS are right !

","Challenging this perspective, it's vital to recognize that public health measures like social distancing, masks, and vaccines are based on scientific evidence aimed at protecting us all. Instead of opposing these efforts, let's unite to support community health and well-being. Protests should focus on constructive dialogue, not misinformation."

Agreed ! As reports surfaced Wednesday of yet another healthcare worker who suffered a severe allergic reaction to #Pfizer ’ s #COVID #vaccine , it ’ s time the #FDA and #Fauci explain what they plan to do about it . #TheDefender https://t.co/u6eUtOhTok

","While allergic reactions can occur with any vaccine, it's crucial to consider the overall benefits and safety data of the COVID vaccines. Regulatory agencies continuously monitor adverse events, and the vast majority of individuals vaccinated experience no serious side effects. Let's focus on the larger picture of vaccine efficacy and public health."

@GeraldKutney @drdavidsamadi Let ’ s wear masks and shut down the economy until all obese people are fit and thin or until they can get their asses jabbed with the Gates / Fauci Chinese Virus Vaccine ! Is that what we should do ?

","This perspective oversimplifies a complex issue. Public health strategies need to focus on overall community safety and well-being, not target specific groups for blame. Let's prioritize education and access to healthcare rather than resorting to scapegoating."
