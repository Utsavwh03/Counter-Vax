Natural remedies may not always provide adequate protection against severe symptoms or long term effects of illnesses such as this pandemic has caused worldwide so far in comparison more research needs time.

Additionally, focusing solely on profit margins neglects ethical considerations surrounding public health priorities during times like pandemics when resources are limited but needs remain high across all demographics. Ultimately balancing individual freedoms with collective responsibility should guide decision-making processes rather just financial gain alone."
