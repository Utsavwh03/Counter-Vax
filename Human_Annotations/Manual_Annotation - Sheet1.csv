"If you are <40, healthy & fit and have no conditions or situations that may put you at extra risk, you do not NEED a vaccine for #covid19 >99% natural recovery. If you've had the virus, you do not NEED a vaccine. The already very ill / very old / very fat should have 2doses.",The more people who are vaccinated the more we protect all parts of the population,What scientific evidence is this based on? This seems like a generalisation and when these are made they generally over simplify and misrepresent the facts. Please provide your sources.
" @johnrobertsFox @AstraZeneca @KyraPhillips I'll take my chances with natural immunity by getting the virus and being treated with Hydroxichloroquine, zpak and zinc.","Those treatments have no known benefit and there is no way to predict how serious your reaction to being infected could be, including death",I would be careful taking a natural approach and then taking non-natural substances which might not be proven or recommended by health experts.
 Insisting on a #vaccine that many people do not NEED will make much more PROFIT than a treatment for the 1% of people who might need one or a preventative #VitaminD supplement. #Ziverdo #Ivermectin #Favipiravir #Ivermectin #Doxycycline,By vaccinating the masses we dramatically reduce the likelihood of anyone getting seriously Ill or dying,Prevention is always better than treatment or cure.
 @TheLiamSturgess @JeanmarcBenoit “CDC and FDA are monitoring reports of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) in people who have received the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine.” per CDC website 🤨 https://t.co/hI9so3W7ze,there is no evidence of long term issues with the vaccine,"Glad they official areas monitoring this for public safety - system is working, gives me confidence. Need to wait for outcomes before jumping to conclusions."
"20+ Countries Suspend Use of AstraZeneca Vaccine, But Regulators Insist ‘Benefits Outweigh Risks’ WHO and the EMA are investigating reports of blood clot-related injuries and deaths after the AstraZeneca COVID vaccine https://t.co/GxQvLEbCXT","The number of clots was in the 10s amongst millions of administered doses, far less risk than being unvaccinated.",Seems suspension based on availability of other vaccines which have lower risk in blood clots. Sensible move.
 @firstmove @CureVacRNA @richardquest Is Covid-19 Vaccine SAFE for Pregnant Women ? ? ? HELL NO !!! Don’t you dare sign that paper unless you can prove 100 % there are absolutely NO BIRTH DEFECTS. (Testing will take 9 months plus 2 years) We don’t want no COVID BABIES.,The technology behind the vaccine is known to fe safe for pregnant women and the far greater danger is to be unvaccinated and catch covid when pregnant,"There is no way to prove 100% of any fact, there is always a chance of finding an adverse result in future. Need to balance low risk of birth defect with risk of having COVID while pregnant."
" If it's so safe why do Pfizer need protection from legal action? So I am afraid to say, for that reason, I am out https://t.co/KAQ95ZFNgF","This was to allow the fast track development of the vaccine, which we required to short circuit the normal testing timescale, not because there is any concerns.","Every product has protection against legal action, even McDonalds has indemnities. It would be naive to think otherwise."
 Moderna to start testing its mRNA COVID-19 vaccine on children – are parents really letting their kids serve as guinea pigs? https://t.co/J8Elm3Obu9 via @dreddymd,Any trials are done under the strictest safety procedures as are used in all trials,Are they only testing on children? What lead up studies have been done to get approval for testing on children? They are not testing experimental medicine on children first.
" @ryan_wardeh @PoliticsForAlI @Telegraph its a mrna ""vaccine"" with technology still in its infancy with potential short term side effects and we have no idea about the long term because the trial is ongoing",Testing has been exhaustive and no issues amongst billions of administered doses,"mrna vaccines are not in their infancy, this tech has been used for many years. The intention of the trial is to study some long term effects and ongoing monitoring."
"@uncommoncents70 @TruthAgape @RosetaniLiving My concern is the long term effects, which obviously haven’t been studied. I’m worried I’ll be watching tv one day and a commercial come on saying “if you or a loved one had the Pfizer/Moderna covid vaccine in 2021, you may be entitled to financial compensation” 😂",The vaccine is based in long known technology with an excellent history of safety,"This is just not based on fact, and there are risks with everything we do everyday and you need to balance the different risk you are willing to accept. These drugs have been through rigorous testing and the long term affects of most drugs cannot be known without long term data."
" @bratton The oldest and the one behind them all, vaccine is a sin.","Vaccines are for the greater good, we all help each other stay safe.",How is this a sin? It is not an immoral action to enhance public safety. This is unhelpful.
" On Tuesday, leaders of the Catholic Church issued a statement urging Catholics to avoid taking Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine due to questions about how it was produced. https://t.co/RxpGlDKwdb",The J&J vaccine is fully compliant with all ethics regulations,Are the catholic church leaders medical experts? I would defer to expertise of medical and scientific experts before I follow lead of religious experts commenting outside their area of knowledge.
" @JackieShandu I Agree totally. The politics of this country is highly monetized it's such a pity. We are hearing that Cyril is busy having talks with Bill Gates on vaccine, and our so called revolutionary opposition are quiet.",I suggest that you check where the information has come from and consider leaving politics out of the decision making process for your own personal health decisions? If you had cancer and needed chemo would you really care who made the drug or would you simply want to get treated to get better?,This is false. Bill Gates has had hardly any involvement in the covid vaccines
"@samanthamarika1 No one should! And I agree. I love Trump and everything he's doing.. but why is he pushing vacz? One of the frontrunners, Moderna, look closely at the name.. it literally means MOD RNA. This script better get flipped soon. https://t.co/fAy8Fhf0HH",I suggest you fact check any links you share - check where the information has come from - try using snopes to verify.,"Yes you could look closely at the name but this is literally not what it means. The vaccine should be pushed, to help all of us."
I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again with 1000% conviction: I’ll get covid19 again before I ever let anyone put any “vaccine” that is approved under this madman’s administration. No fu—king way!,So you would put your politics above the health of other people? Vaccination is not just to protect you.,Why? Getting covid again will boost your immunity. But you’ll be better off having the jab before covid. You could end up very unwell without it.
" @KrutikaKuppalli @moderna_tx Why vaccinate children who have extremely high survival rates? Florida has a recorded 1 in 10,000 CFR for pediatric patients. What that looks like to me is a profit motivated trail which could result in serious injuries to children. I'm not OK with that.","Children aren't being forced to have the vaccination, its for their parents of guardians to do their research and decide on the risk vs benefits, Floridas results are just one aspect to be looked at.",Because everyone is better protected against this virus. Some children had respiratory illness unknowingly too.
" @GammaRetro With such guaranteed indemnity, rigorous testing becomes an unnecessary expense. Did you notice that Pfizer et al are upping their vaccine purchase price?",No amount of indemity can possibly negate the damage to a company if they fail to test rigorously and then are found to be responsible for any negative effects. The reputational damage would affect their entire business not just vaccine production.,Testing is still necessary to help with the new uptick in covid variants. It is helpful to also spot any issues the vaccine may have.
 @realDonaldTrump Please don't push Corona/China virus vaccine on us make it voluntary. We don't trust vaccinations or anything to do with Bill Gates and friends pushing their agenda of vaccine chips and NWO!! Please stop this from happening.,Where to begin - this is false information based on politics.,It will be voluntary. But having the vaccine is the right thing to do. For both yourself and people around the world.
"The developers of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine have previously undisclosed ties to the re-named British Eugenics Society, the Galton Institute, as well as other Eugenics-linked institutions like the Wellcome Trust. https://t.co/zMgcmYpwRM",I suggest you fact check any links you share - check where the information has come from - try using snopes to verify.,They will literally have many ties as an internationally known university team of researchers.
" Im not taking a vaccine just because trump says its ok, not gonna happen","Politics should not be used to imform whether or not vaccination is for you, look at the sceintific arguments for and against and then decide.",But it might just save your life. The vaccine is there to protect you and others.
"@NHSuk My GP contacted me to take the covid vaccine, I declined. No vaccine for me",Can you say why you won't consider the vaccine? To protect others as well as yourself.,Why? You NOT having the vaccine is causing this pandemic to be prolonged.
" TPTB are pushing for “mandatory” vaccines, meaning, you are EXCLUDED from society until you acquiesce. No exceptions. It’s patriotic duty. – Production Of Russian COVID-19 Vaccine Begins As Asian Demand Soars https://t.co/xmOXg8Bpyt",I suggest you fact check any links you share - check where the information has come from - try using snopes to verify.,Having the vaccines helps society move on. You not having the vaccine is what is causing this.
" Absolutely do not submit to this ""vaccine passport"" nonsense. This is a massive threat being engineered against the people.",Perhaps you could say more about this? In what way is this a threat and who is engineering it?,It is being done for everyone’s health. Nothing else. We would be in a worse situation without vaccine passports.
 @goodfoodgal Absolutely frightening times. Forcing an untested vaccine on the public. Just crazy. I hope this shit isn't forced I'm Australia.,"No one is forced to have the vaccine, this is a false argument.",The vaccine has been already proved enough that it helps reduce hospitalisations and cases.

 Suspicions grow that nanoparticles in Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine trigger rare allergic reactions (Jop de Vrieze / Science) https://t.co/8SN6elNZoC https://t.co/ORNOpMbmuG",Allergic reactions can be triggered by ANYTHING!! it's common sense that the vaccine is going to trigger an allergic reaction in a small number of the population,How rare? How many people will get those? As opposed to how many of those people could die from COVID given they have rare genes responsible for allergic reactions? Think about it.

 @bazakel @ScottMorrisonMP Fuck off. Do you know what’s in vaccines. For a start cell cultures from Aborted baby cells. The Oxford vaccines that Morrison is pushing is made from a virus that is found in chimpanzees. A lot of the vaccines change a persons DNA so the ingredients can get into your T Cells",How do you think modern medicine exists?? You have to introduce the virus sometimes to ensure you acquire immunity against it,"I think it is an interesting point, did you read it on reddit? I'd like to give some further proof of these aborted baby cells. But even then, chimpanzees and aborted babies are close to humans, and many of the vaccines/meds that you normally take for a plain flu contain the same stuff."

 @CocoMccool @ConceptualJames The AZ vax is much more questionable than the JNJ vaccine, despite being on the same platform JNJ didnt add human-derived sequences to increase the efficacy of their vaccine -- AZ did In terms of safety (all else equal), traditional vax are the least safe and RNA are the safest","Each vaccine has it's benefits, depending on the virus you are vaccinating for","I completely agree with you, I have personally received AZ and only then found out about dangers for people of my age. I think it was more of a panic in the very beginning, there are now some really good sources of finding out which vaccine would be most appropriate for you: https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/covid-19-vaccine-comparison"

 @mark199 @toryboypierce @AstraZeneca Not sure on what part of the vaccine doesn't stop you catching/infecting/dying from the virus that you're not quite grasping.",The vaccines can significantly reduce the risk of catching/ infecting / dying from the virus,"It doesn't stop you, but it significantly reduces the chances. If you had a 100% chance of dying from cancer with no chemo or a 50% chance to survive with, what would you choose?"

 @MattHancock @UniofOxford There are so many variants there will never be a vaccine that will ensure any form of safety. https://t.co/0PYAFyRWdF","Whilst you can't cover every variant, if the vaccine can protect and save lives for some then surely it's worth it?","it's a fair point, but the vaccine and antibodies in our bodies are also adapting to changes. Having no antibodies at all puts you more at risk rather than having an additional chance of being protected WITH the vaccine."

 @SkyNewsBreak The bullshit starts. The other company said 95% effective and now #pfizer saying same. Next they will tell us it's safe and doesn't need to be transported at - 70degC. Clearly announcements are made to affect share price not safety or effectiveness @toryboypierce @piersmorgan",Fact - knowledge about vaccines are forever evolving and recommendations will change accordingly,"When the vaccines first came out, we were all in a bit of a rush and panic to end the pandemic ASAP. I trust more recent research a lot more these days, since it's literally been YEARS worth of research. these things make a lot more sense now, just look up research you trust."

 @TheEliKlein You think vaccine is safer than Covid for an 18 year old? 🤔",Sadly young people are not immune from the virus - covid doesn't discriminate against age. If you can reduce your risk of serious illness then why not,"Covid is not as scary for young people and there were far fewer deaths indeed (https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/articles/covid19vaccinationandmortalityinyoungpeopleduringthecoronaviruspandemic/2022-03-22), but it does not mean there were NO deaths.

 @RT_com Injecting a Russian vaccine is like depending on a Lada as your daily driver",Perhaps the vaccine might just save your life though??,"I would have to argue with both of these here.

Not everything that comes from Russia needs to be terrible, only the Putin."

 More than a coincidence then that the 3 billionaires funding the Pfizer vaccine have all stated that in their opinion the biggest problem we have is overpopulation.",Perhaps the 3 billionaires could share some of their wealth with the population then,"It is, have you been on public transport lately? I would believe it when I see death rates from the vaccines. So far, there are so many more deaths from COVID, do you think it was those 3 billionaires who sponsored it too?"

 @inquirerdotnet Duturte is either working with Trump to bring down the deep state or he's really not to bright. If he is really pushing a vaccine that means he's siding with China.
