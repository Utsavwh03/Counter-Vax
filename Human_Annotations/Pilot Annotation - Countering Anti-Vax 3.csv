@bazakel @ScottMorrisonMP Fuck off. Do you know what’s in vaccines. For a start cell cultures from Aborted baby cells. The Oxford vaccines that Morrison is pushing is made from a virus that is found in chimpanzees. A lot of the vaccines change a persons DNA so the ingredients can get into your T Cells ","Please write a counter-argument for this tweet:

@CocoMccool @ConceptualJames The AZ vax is much more questionable than the JNJ vaccine, despite being on the same platform JNJ didnt add human-derived sequences to increase the efficacy of their vaccine -- AZ did In terms of safety (all else equal), traditional vax are the least safe and RNA are the safest ","Please write a counter-argument for this tweet:

@mark199 @toryboypierce @AstraZeneca Not sure on what part of the vaccine doesn't stop you catching/infecting/dying from the virus that you're not quite grasping. ","Please write a counter-argument for this tweet:

@SkyNewsBreak The bullshit starts. The other company said 95% effective and now #pfizer saying same. Next they will tell us it's safe and doesn't need to be transported at - 70degC.

More than a coincidence then that the 3 billionaires funding the Pfizer vaccine have all stated that in their opinion the biggest problem we have is overpopulation. ","Please write a counter-argument for this tweet:

If the whole Covid schema is a SCAM (as the producer of tests R. Hodkinson said) how can you possibly do a ""classical vaccine"" as previous? ⚡️💉 YOU CAN'T 💉⚡️ Hence is all synthetic and pure gene-therapy! GMO-humans. https://t.co/8KNjFbhVCD ","Please write a counter-argument for this tweet:

@inquirerdotnet Duturte is either working with Trump to bring down the deep state or he's really not to bright. If he is really pushing a vaccine that means he's siding with China.

You have to introduce the virus sometimes to ensure you acquire immunity against it","Each vaccine has it's benefits, depending on the virus you are vaccinating for","The vaccines can significantly reduce the risk of catching/ infecting / dying from the virus","Whilst you can't cover every variant, if the vaccine can protect and save lives for some then surely it's worth it?","Fact - knowledge about vaccines are forever evolving and recommendations will change accordingly","Sadly young people are not immune from the virus - covid doesn't discriminate against age. If you can reduce your risk of serious illness then why not","good for you, positive attitude that you're embracing Chinese vaccines","Perhaps the vaccine might just save your life though??","Perhaps the 3 billionaires could share some of their wealth with the population then","Do you know anything about vaccines at all?? some are live vaccines whilst others are synthetically produced","How is pushing a vaccine siding with China?? it's about protecting world health!!","Overall the tweets were easy to understand"

As opposed to how many of those people could die from COVID given they have rare genes responsible for allergic reactions? Think about it. ","I think it is an interesting point, did you read it on reddit? I'd like to give some further proof of these aborted baby cells. But even then, chimpanzees and aborted babies are close to humans, and many of the vaccines/meds that you normally take for a plain flu contain the same stuff. ","I completely agree with you, I have personally received AZ and only then found out about dangers for people of my age. I think it was more of a panic in the very beginning, there are now some really good sources of finding out which vaccine would be most appropriate for you: https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/covid-19-vaccine-comparison","It doesn't stop you, but it significantly reduces the chances. If you had a 100% chance of dying from cancer with no chemo or a 50% chance to survive with, what would you choose? ","it's a fair point, but the vaccine and antibodies in our bodies are also adapting to changes. Having no antibodies at all puts you more at risk rather than having an additional chance of being protected WITH the vaccine. ","When the vaccines first came out, we were all in a bit of a rush and panic to end the pandemic ASAP. I trust more recent research a lot more these days, since it's literally been YEARS worth of research. these things make a lot more sense now, just look up research you trust. ","Covid is not as scary for young people and there were far fewer deaths indeed (https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/articles/covid19vaccinationandmortalityinyoungpeopleduringthecoronaviruspandemic/2022-03-22), but it does not mean there were NO deaths. If you compare stats of vaccine side effects vs probability of dying from COVID, the latter is scarier. ","Most of the things that you 'take' or 'use' are Chinese-made :) It has been long standing stereotype that things made in China are of a lower quality, but in this case it has proven to be wrong, as it is as effective and China have not had many cases for a very long time now. https://news.google.com/covid19/map?hl=en-GB&mid=/m/0fbp0&gl=GB&ceid=GB:en","I would have to argue with both of these here. It may not be 'fancy' and 'well-known' as other cars, but there are no safety issues with it. Could say the same thing about the vaccine. Not everything that comes from Russia needs to be terrible, only the Putin. ","It is, have you been on public transport lately? I would believe it when I see death rates from the vaccines. So far, there are so many more deaths from COVID, do you think it was those 3 billionaires who sponsored it too? ","I have a strong view of people claiming something GMO is automatically negative. there really is NO proof that is the case. I do not know enough about the structure of vaccines to argue here, but even if they are classed as GMO, what exactly is wrong with that? ","The vaccines have been extremely beneficial and reduced levels of COVID across the world. How is supporting something that has proven effective ""siding"" with someone? Worldwide collaboration is what we need to fight the pandemic. ","All clear, some tweets were tricky especially those with surnames (had to google the first one) "
