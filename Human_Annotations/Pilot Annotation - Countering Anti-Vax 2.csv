@KrutikaKuppalli @moderna_tx Why vaccinate children who have extremely high survival rates? Florida has a recorded 1 in 10,000 CFR for pediatric patients.

Vaccination is not just to protect you.","Children aren't being forced to have the vaccination, its for their parents of guardians to do their research and decide on the risk vs benefits, Floridas results are just one aspect to be looked at.

","Why? Getting covid again will boost your immunity. But you’ll be better off having the jab before covid. You could end up very unwell without it. ","Because everyone is better protected against this virus. Some children had respiratory illness unknowingly too. ","Testing is still necessary to help with the new uptick in covid variants.
