The news",pharma rushed,"While it is important to have transparency and peer review in the development of vaccines, it is also crucial to prioritize speed in a situation like a global pandemic. Pfizer may have pushed through their vaccine quickly because the need for a vaccine was urgent. Additionally, Pfizer has a long history of successful vaccine development and regulatory approval. Just because Inovio Pharma submitted a peer review earlier does not necessarily mean their vaccine is a better option. Fast-tracking the Pfizer vaccine could have been a necessary step in quickly providing protection to the public."

Different vaccines may have different levels of media coverage and public interest for various reasons. The efficacy and safety of a vaccine should be evaluated based on scientific evidence and data, not just on how much attention it receives."

The COVID-19 vaccines have undergone rigorous testing and have been proven to be safe and effective in clinical trials involving thousands of participants. Additionally, the urgency of the pandemic necessitated expedited development and distribution of the vaccines, but this does not mean that safety was compromised. It is crucial to trust in the scientific process and the regulatory bodies that oversee the approval of vaccines. Being skeptical is understandable, but it is important to base our beliefs on evidence and expert guidance."

The government is simply following public health guidelines to ensure the safety of students and the general public by requiring vaccinations before returning to school. It is not uncommon for individuals to have to pay for alternative vaccines if the free supply is limited.

I doubt it .",country,"While it is important to prioritize vaccines that have been approved by reputable organizations like the EU, dismissing the Chinese vaccine entirely could be detrimental. It is crucial to consider all options in order to ensure widespread vaccination and ultimately achieve herd immunity. Additionally, questioning Orban's ability to organize mass vaccination overlooks the fact that successful vaccination campaigns require cooperation and coordination from all parties involved."

The real purpose of the Covid vaccine is to protect public health and save lives, not to manipulate or control people. Being informed and educated about the benefits of vaccination is essential in combating the spread of the virus and returning to a sense of normalcy."

This world is a joke .,side-effect,"While it may seem frustrating that a vaccine for a new disease was developed quickly while a cure for cancer is still elusive, it's important to recognize that the two are vastly different in terms of complexity and treatment approach. Developing a vaccine for a virus like COVID-19 is different from finding a cure for cancer, which involves a wide range of different diseases that are each unique in their behavior and treatment methods. Comparing the two in this way oversimplifies the challenges and advancements in medical research."

Some vaccine manufacturers use other vaccines as ' placebo ' , while others use true placebo's .",rushed,"Using other vaccines as placebos in clinical trials for new vaccines can be a valid and necessary practice in order to determine the relative efficacy and safety of the new vaccine. This approach allows researchers to have a comparison group that is already receiving some level of protection, rather than completely withholding any form of vaccination from participants in the control group. Ultimately, the goal is to determine whether the new vaccine provides additional benefit compared to existing vaccines, so using other vaccines as placebos can be a scientifically sound approach."

The CDC may not have physically isolated the COVID-19 virus itself, but they have identified and sequenced its RNA through various testing methods. The development of a vaccine is based on years of research and understanding of similar viruses, allowing scientists to determine the necessary RNA sequence to target for immunity. The amount of RNA needed to produce an illness is also studied through clinical trials and experimentation to ensure the safety and effectiveness of vaccines."

Logic is hard .,rushed,"While it is true that there are instances of inherent unfairness in the world, it is important to recognize the progress that has been made towards addressing these injustices. Making a vaccine for Covid-19 demonstrates a commitment to saving lives and preventing future deaths, and stopping a murderer after their fourth victim is a necessary measure to protect the safety and well-being of society. While it may be difficult to understand the complexities of these situations, it is important to acknowledge the efforts being made to promote fairness and justice in society."

COVID-19 has led to a significantly higher number of deaths worldwide compared to the flu, and the long-term effects of the virus on those who survive can be severe.

Vaccines not only protect the individual receiving them, but also help protect those who are unable to be vaccinated or who may have weakened immune systems. Choosing not to vaccinate can put others at risk, so it is important to weigh the potential consequences on the community as a whole.

There is no scientific evidence to suggest that the AstraZeneca vaccine can cause dementia or memory loss. It is possible that these symptoms are unrelated to the vaccine and should be properly assessed and diagnosed by a medical professional.
1407440397031280644t,@MJA_Editor I would be a bit concerned about the Israeli reports of Myocarditis in young men following a Pfizer vaccine . Most were mild but some ended up in ICU . Covid in healthy young people usually is not severe . I would avoid Pfizer in young lads . https://t.co/fGWAHBTYIn,side-effect,"While it is important to consider potential risks associated with any vaccine, it is also important to acknowledge the significant benefits of vaccination in preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19. The incidence of myocarditis following the Pfizer vaccine is still extremely rare, and the overall benefits of vaccination far outweigh the potential risks. It is important to consult with healthcare professionals and weigh the risks and benefits on an individual basis rather than making blanket recommendations based on isolated reports."
1345361992392056833t,@keirshiels @marcuschown What is the point exactly - Pfizer itself says the vaccine is useless if the 2nd jab isn't given within the correct time frame or are you 2nd vaccinating your elderly frail patients ?,ineffective,"While it is true that Pfizer recommends administering the second dose within a specific time frame for maximum effectiveness, any level of protection is better than none. By vaccinating elderly frail patients with the first dose, we can still help reduce their risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19. It is a step in the right direction towards achieving herd immunity and protecting the most vulnerable members of society."

It is crucial to trust in the scientific community and their rigorous evaluation processes for vaccine safety and efficacy.
