The CDC and WHO recommend that pregnant women discuss the decision to get vaccinated with their healthcare provider to weigh the potential benefits and risks. Additionally, extensive research and clinical trials have been conducted to ensure the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women.

A cure will interfere with ‘ Great Reset ’ !,none,This claim is unsubstantiated and lacks evidence. Pfizer likely provided the report to both presidential candidates for transparency and preparation purposes. The speed at which a vaccine can be distributed globally is influenced by various factors beyond the control of the pharmaceutical company or any political party. Accusing the elites of intentionally withholding a vaccine for their own agenda is a baseless conspiracy theory.

The 5% of people who may experience adverse reactions to a medication should not discount the positive impact it can have on the other 95%. Pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer invest significant resources into research and development to bring new and effective treatments to market, and their success should not be dismissed solely based on potential side effects. Additionally, the FDA closely monitors the safety and efficacy of medications before they are approved for public use."

Just because someone dies within 28 days of receiving a vaccine does not mean that the vaccine was the cause of death. There are countless other factors that could contribute to someone's death during that timeframe. Reporting it in the manner suggested would be irresponsible and could perpetuate misinformation.

There are many factors that could have led to this decision, such as logistical challenges or a surplus of vaccines in Africa. Additionally, Health Canada approved the AstraZeneca vaccine based on rigorous scientific evidence and recommendations from experts, not because it was seen as ineffective or less effective. Blaming Justin Trudeau or Health Canada for this decision is unfair and misguided."
1326119611562160129t,"@pfizer #Pathetic - won't take your vaccine , strictly a political hack job and potential criminal activity !",political unnecessary,"Actually, the Pfizer vaccine has been rigorously tested and approved by health authorities worldwide.

If you have a viable vaccine , announce it after the election . Plenty of time to announce and distribute .",pharma political,"While some may argue that Pfizer announcing a vaccine close to the election could be seen as interference, it is important to consider that the timing of such announcements may be driven by scientific progress and the urgency of addressing a global pandemic. Holding back potentially life-saving information for political reasons could be seen as irresponsible and harmful to public health."

Their argument ... ” vaccines saves lives ... ” 🧐 🙄 .,country side-effect,"One could argue that the comparison between a woman's right to choose what happens to her own body and a vaccine that protects public health is flawed. The decision to have an abortion is a personal and deeply complex choice, while getting vaccinated is a responsible decision to protect not only oneself, but also others in the community. Additionally, vaccines have been shown to effectively prevent the spread of infectious diseases and save lives, making them a crucial tool in combating health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic."

If the vaccine these people take and believe in is so good , then whats the issue with people that havent had it , surely they are safe haha",conspiracy side-effect,"The issue with unvaccinated individuals is not just about their own safety, but about the potential for them to spread the virus to others who may be more vulnerable and unable to get vaccinated. Vaccination is not just about individual protection, but about creating herd immunity to protect the entire community."

Not like our vaccines .,country ineffective,"While it is true that some Chinese individuals may be receiving lower efficacy vaccines, it is important to recognize that access to vaccines varies greatly around the world. The Chinese vaccines may still provide protection and help prevent the spread of COVID-19, and it is unfair to dismiss them as inferior simply based on their origin. All vaccines, including those developed in other countries, play a crucial role in controlling the pandemic and saving lives."

It is natural for there to be a wide range of articles and opinions on population decline, but it is crucial to rely on credible sources for accurate information. Ultimately, the overwhelming support for the vaccine from experts and scientific studies should not be overshadowed by unfounded conspiracy theories."

Look up Harvard 2003 gates Lieber nano virology research . Im sure it was all innocent .. NOT !,ingredients rushed,"Actually, the reason why Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine requires storage at -70C is because the mRNA technology used in the vaccine is highly delicate and can degrade quickly at higher temperatures. This has nothing to do with experimental nanotech components or any nefarious motives. The strict storage requirements are simply a result of the nature of the vaccine technology."

Getting a common cold is a small price to pay if it means protecting oneself and others from a potentially deadly virus. Additionally, the Russian vaccine has shown promising results in clinical trials and has been authorized for use in multiple countries."

The UK vaccine may be in development, but that doesn't mean it's automatically more trustworthy. It's also unfair to call someone a guinea pig for participating in a clinical trial - they are helping advance medical science for the benefit of everyone. Trust in the scientific process and consider the potential benefits of vaccination."
