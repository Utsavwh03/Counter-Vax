1337328164880719872t,@dunxen @pierredevos It takes your body a minimum of two years to form antibodies after taking any vaccine so it's actually kind of useless because after six months the strain would have already mutated as it has already so how many times will you inject yourself with COVID ?,ineffective,"While the claim that it takes two years to form antibodies from a vaccine is inaccurate, it's important to recognize that vaccines are designed to trigger an immune response much more quickly—often within weeks. The body typically begins producing antibodies in response to vaccination shortly after the dose is administered. 

Moreover, vaccines remain effective against various strains of viruses, including COVID-19, due to the way they prepare the immune system to recognize and combat pathogens. Even as viruses mutate, vaccines can still provide substantial protection, often preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death. This is evidenced by numerous studies demonstrating that vaccinated individuals generally have better health outcomes compared to those who are unvaccinated, even against emerging variants.

Furthermore, booster doses are recommended to enhance and prolong immunity, which helps keep up with virus mutations. Far from being ""useless,"" vaccines are a crucial tool in controlling infectious diseases and have shown to significantly reduce the burden of illness in populations."

The mRNA technology used in vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna has been studied for years prior to the pandemic, and the accelerated timeline was largely due to unprecedented global collaboration and funding, not compromised safety. 

Furthermore, vaccination mandates are rooted in public health principles aimed at protecting vulnerable populations and achieving herd immunity. Personal choice is important, but it must be balanced with the responsibility we have to protect community health. By vaccinating, individuals not only safeguard themselves but also contribute to the well-being of those who cannot be vaccinated, like individuals with specific health conditions. Thus, policies promoting vaccination are not just about mandates; they are about collective responsibility to combat a global health crisis."

Studies have demonstrated that vaccinated individuals who do contract the virus are less likely to transmit it to others compared to unvaccinated individuals. This reduction in transmission, combined with widespread vaccination, contributes to herd immunity, ultimately allowing societies to reopen safely.

Moreover, the success of vaccines in controlling other infectious diseases, such as measles and polio, highlights their vital role in public health. Vaccines are a critical tool for managing outbreaks and protecting vulnerable populations. Therefore, the argument that vaccines don’t contribute to controlling the pandemic fails to recognize their proven effectiveness in reducing the impact of COVID-19, allowing for safer reopening and recovery."

So @BorisJohnson has opened the Genie to the Indian Variant #COVID and now the #UK vaccination ( mass ) has been worthless ... Well Done Boris ! #Borisisaclown #IndianVariant,political,"While it is true that variants can emerge and potentially evade immunity, vaccines still play a crucial role in reducing severe illness, hospitalizations, and deaths caused by COVID-19, including from variants. The perception that vaccines are ineffective against variants often overlooks the extensive research demonstrating that even if vaccines do not completely prevent infection, they significantly lessen the severity of the disease. 

Moreover, political factors heavily influence public perception of vaccines. Misinformation, politicization of health measures, and inconsistent messaging can lead to skepticism about vaccines' efficacy. For example, political leaders might downplay their importance, creating a narrative that undermines public trust. To foster a more accurate understanding, it is essential to emphasize the scientific consensus on vaccines as a critical tool in combating COVID-19 and to promote transparency and evidence-based communication, regardless of political affiliations."

Vaccines undergo rigorous testing in multiple phases before approval, including large-scale clinical trials that monitor for short- and long-term side effects. Regulatory bodies like Health Canada and the CDC continuously review vaccine data, and any signals of potential reproductive toxicity are taken seriously, with no conclusive evidence linking COVID-19 vaccines to infertility.

Moreover, the risks associated with COVID-19 itself, including severe illness, long-term complications, and death, significantly outweigh the potential risks posed by vaccines. The daily death toll from COVID-19 can often surpass the numbers associated with vaccine adverse reactions, which remain rare. Vaccination not only protects individuals but also helps to establish herd immunity, ultimately reducing the spread of the virus and protecting vulnerable populations. It’s crucial to weigh the risks of vaccination against the far greater risks posed by the virus itself and to base decisions on comprehensive, evidence-based information."

Firstly, the vaccines, including Pfizer, significantly reduce the severity of illness, hospitalizations, and deaths, even as breakthrough infections occur, particularly in highly vaccinated populations. Studies indicate that vaccinated individuals are less likely to experience severe outcomes compared to unvaccinated individuals.

Additionally, the increase in cases does not necessarily mean the vaccine is ineffective. Immunity can wane over time, which is why booster shots are recommended to enhance protection. Importantly, Israel's high vaccination rate has largely helped to keep severe cases and hospitalizations lower than in populations with lower vaccination rates.

Lastly, the dynamics of viral spread, including the emergence of variants and social behaviors, can influence case numbers. Instead of viewing rising cases as a failure of the vaccine, it is essential to recognize the vaccine's role in mitigating the impact of the virus and protecting public health.

Fake news reporting on increase of covid but never the death toll . INTERESTING !,political,"The argument that COVID-19 vaccines are somehow less valid than cancer treatments overlooks several key points. First, the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines was driven by an unprecedented global health crisis, showcasing the scientific community's ability to mobilize resources and research quickly. In contrast, cancer is a complex group of diseases, and while there are prevention strategies and treatments, creating a universal vaccine for such a diverse array of cancers is far more challenging and not as feasible.

Additionally, the perception of vaccines is often influenced by political factors, including misinformation campaigns that exploit fear and distrust in public health measures. Public figures and political rhetoric can skew the narrative, causing people to undervalue the proven safety and efficacy of vaccines while overemphasizing their perceived risks. This can create a false equivalence between the challenges of developing a vaccine for a highly variable disease like cancer and the successful, swift deployment of COVID-19 vaccines.

Numerous studies indicate that vaccinated people who contract the virus tend to have lower viral loads, which diminishes their ability to spread the virus to others. Moreover, widespread vaccination contributes to herd immunity, making it harder for the virus to spread within the community and protecting those who cannot be vaccinated, such as individuals with certain health conditions. Therefore, getting vaccinated is not only a personal health choice but also a crucial part of public health strategy to safeguard everyone."

There has been no published evidence to support the Russian Ministry of Health ’ s statements that the vaccine generates useful antibodies and has limited side effects .",side-effect,"While it's true that some individuals may experience side effects or adverse reactions to vaccines, the overwhelming majority of vaccine recipients report only mild and temporary effects, such as soreness at the injection site or mild fever. Serious side effects are exceedingly rare and are continually monitored by health authorities. Moreover, the benefits of vaccination—such as the prevention of severe disease, hospitalization, and death—greatly outweigh these risks. The evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of vaccines is robust, coming from extensive clinical trials and ongoing real-world studies. Dismissing vaccines based on isolated concerns ignores the comprehensive data that support their use in protecting public health."
1339987502174748672t,"@PClement_ @jjmib @glesgaweegie @piersmorgan The experimental vaccine - 21500 control group who did not take the vaccine 99.63 % did not develop Covid , 0.37 % did . The vaccine group 99.07 % did not develop Covid 0.023 % did . Testing takes circa 2 years - public are being used to test this novel vaccine . It is reckless .",rushed,"While concerns about vaccine safety and testing timelines are valid, it's important to understand the rigorous processes that vaccines go through before approval. The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, for instance, were subject to extensive clinical trials involving tens of thousands of participants, allowing scientists to gather robust data on their safety and efficacy. The accelerated development was made possible by unprecedented global collaboration and funding, not by compromising safety standards. Regulatory bodies like the FDA and EMA perform thorough evaluations before granting emergency use authorization, ensuring that the benefits of vaccination, particularly in preventing severe illness and death from COVID-19, far outweigh potential risks. The data shows that vaccinated individuals have significantly lower rates of infection and severe outcomes compared to unvaccinated groups, demonstrating the vaccines' effectiveness in real-world settings."

It will make their people sick , it wii make you sick .",country side-effect,"While it's important to critically assess vaccines from any country, dismissing them entirely based on national bias can hinder access to potentially effective treatments. Many vaccines, regardless of origin, undergo rigorous testing and regulatory approval processes before public distribution. Moreover, every vaccine, including those developed in the U.S., Europe, or Russia, can have side effects and adverse reactions. Instead of outright rejection, we should focus on transparent research and data sharing, accepting that safety and efficacy can vary, but so does the reality of global health challenges. Promoting informed choices based on scientific evidence rather than nationality will ultimately serve public health better."

It'll make a lot of Americans sick / dead , creating widespread fear of gov't , science , medicine & destabilize US . #TraitorTrump will do nothing . Putin will invade US in chaos .",country side-effect,"While concerns about vaccines from specific countries, including Russia, are understandable due to political biases and historical mistrust, it’s essential to evaluate the safety and efficacy of any vaccine based on scientific evidence rather than the origin of its production. National biases can cloud judgment and lead to unwarranted fears that ultimately undermine public health efforts. Regulatory bodies like the FDA review vaccines rigorously, ensuring they meet established safety standards regardless of their source. Additionally, it is important to recognize that all medications and vaccines can have side effects and adverse reactions; however, these risks must be assessed in the context of the overwhelming benefits vaccines provide in preventing serious illness and preserving public health. Promoting a scientifically grounded discourse, rather than fear-based narratives, is crucial for informed decision-making and addressing vaccine hesitancy."
1427998739222892546t,GILL GOT HER INTERCEPTED YESTERDAY ... NO BREAK OUT The canadian govt sold canadians to the chinese to experiment on this is why PK SAID HE IS WORKING FOR THE GOVT WHY ARE WE BEING FORCED TO TAKE A VACCINE FOR A VIRUS THAT CAME FROM CHINA ? https://t.co/nMUBUoJc6j,mandatory political,"While concerns about personal choice are valid, vaccination policies are largely based on protecting public health and preventing widespread outbreaks. Vaccines have demonstrated their effectiveness in controlling infectious diseases, which is crucial in the context of a global pandemic. The assertion that the Canadian government sold its citizens for experiments lacks credible evidence and fosters unnecessary fear.

Moreover, the origin of the virus does not negate the scientific consensus on the safety and efficacy of vaccines. Vaccination not only protects individuals but also contributes to the overall immunity of communities, especially for those who cannot be vaccinated due to medical reasons. The politicization of vaccination can exacerbate mistrust, but it is important to rely on data-driven research and public health guidelines. Ultimately, the choice to vaccinate is not just personal; it impacts the health and safety of society as a whole."
1264685032481923078t,"@JNJNews @JanssenGlobal No one needs a vaccine for COVID - 19 . 98.8 % survival rate . Same as the common flu . Common flu has a "" vaccine "" that does nothing but give you the flu and make companies , like yours , more $ $ $ .",pharma unnecessary,"While it's true that the survival rate for COVID-19 is high for many individuals, focusing solely on survival rates overlooks the severe health complications and long-term effects that can arise even in mild cases. Vaccines, including those for COVID-19, are essential tools that not only protect individuals but also contribute to herd immunity, reducing overall transmission and protecting vulnerable populations who cannot be vaccinated. 

Concerns about profit motives in the pharmaceutical industry are valid and warrant scrutiny; however, the overwhelming consensus among public health experts highlights that the benefits of vaccination far outweigh these concerns. Vaccines have historically proven to be successful in controlling and eradicating diseases, demonstrating their necessity beyond corporate profits. Ultimately, vaccination plays a critical role in safeguarding public health and preventing future outbreaks, making it an essential measure in combating COVID-19."
1407440397031280644t,@MJA_Editor I would be a bit concerned about the Israeli reports of Myocarditis in young men following a Pfizer vaccine . Most were mild but some ended up in ICU . Covid in healthy young people usually is not severe . I would avoid Pfizer in young lads . https://t.co/fGWAHBTYIn,side-effect,"While concerns about myocarditis following mRNA vaccines like Pfizer's are valid, it's important to consider the broader context. Studies show that the incidence rates of myocarditis in vaccinated individuals are significantly lower than the risks associated with COVID-19 itself, which can lead to severe illness, long-term health issues, or even death in young individuals. Additionally, the vast majority of myocarditis cases linked to vaccines are mild and resolve with treatment. Vaccines also play a critical role in achieving herd immunity and reducing virus spread, which is vital for protecting vulnerable populations. Ultimately, the benefits of vaccination in preventing severe COVID-19 complications far outweigh the relatively rare potential side effects."
1303735417104224257t,In Italy real scientists give interviews to the press without fear of gov reprisals . Most likely no vaccine for years . Serious negative reaction to Oxford vaccine in ph 3 due to cutting corners should have been found in ph 1 . Quarantine should be 7 days . https://t.co/FkXPKlMFDT,side-effect,"While concerns about potential side effects and adverse reactions associated with vaccines are valid and should be taken seriously, it's important to consider the broader context of vaccine safety and efficacy. Vaccines undergo rigorous testing through multiple phases of clinical trials to evaluate their safety, which includes identifying adverse reactions. The vast majority of vaccine side effects are mild and temporary, such as soreness at the injection site or mild fever.

Serious adverse reactions are extremely rare, and health authorities like the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continuously monitor vaccine safety even after approval. Quarantine measures are based on current scientific understanding of virus transmission and are regularly updated with emerging data. Ensuring widespread vaccination is a key strategy in controlling pandemics and preventing severe illness, underscoring the importance of trusting established scientific processes and expertise, rather than focusing solely on isolated incidents."
